REDATIVE PRONOUN.

Bssmss its ordinary grammatica] construction, the relative pro-
noun has, in most languages, a number of uses, which, from their

rather than to be accounted exceptione. Some of these are intimately
connected with, and tend to throw light on, the history and pro-

and Latin authors, illustrated, where convenient, from the practice
of our own or any kindred language3¹ and also collected at large
from writers of all periods without reference to style. Itis to be

parallel Latin and Greek construction, has not been carried further
in grammatical and syntectical works 3 and more especially that it
has not been followed out in books of exercises for composition, as
used in the higher classes of schools. As regards the latter, viz.
the unreserved selection of examples from authors of any age or
style, but little apology is necessary. 'lhe aim os a good syn-

tactical treatise is, in general, at least threefold: first, to illustrate

the origin of particular forms of construction, and the way in

which diversities of expression have sprung from a common source3

to be found in any author, ancient or modern, or in whatever

dialect composed, whose works are of value3 and thirdly, to supply
