Kriiger, vol. ii. 215. We might, however, explain the arbem
quam statuo vestra est, by supposing the construction to be statuo
arbem ουσαν est vestra, where the relative would then be attracted
to urbem. In the following passage, we have a word in apposition
with a noun in the demonstrative clause, attracted into a different
case, in consequence of the interventiones a relative clause, and
made to take the case ot the relatives εἰδομένη γαλόῳ, Ἀντη-
υορίδαω δάμαρτι, τὴν Ἀντηνορίδης εἶχε κρείων Ἑλικάων, Λαο-
δ ι’ κη υ, Πριάμοιο θυγατρῶν εἶδος ἀρί στ n ν, Hom. Il. γ’. 122.

Oba. Many os the cases in which the accusative os a noun begins the
clause, and where, atter the interposition of the relative clause, the con-
struction changes to the nominative by what is called anacoluthon, might
perhaps admit of explanation in this way, as in the subjoined example:
λέγω δέσοι· τὸν ἀνδρα τοῦτον, ὃν πάλαιζητεῖς.... οὗτός ἐστιν
ἐνθάδε, ξένος λόγῳ μέτοικος, OEdip. Tyr. 444. There is, however, another
explanation which I would propose, viz. to regard this as an instance of a
well-known Greek construction, λέγω τὸν ἄνδρα τοῦτον ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν
ἐνθάδε, the repetition of οὗτος resulting from the parenthesis. But this
will not explain all the cases of this kind. Thus, λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν, ὅτι πᾶν
ῥῆμα ἀργὸν, ὃ ἐὰν λαλήσωσιυ οἱ ἄνθρωποι, ἀποδώσουσι περὶ αιίποῦ
λόγον, Matt. xii. 36, where the attracted words, πᾶν ῥῆμα ἀργὸν, are a
secondary object to ἀποδώσουσι, whose proper construction is represented
by περὶ αὑτοῦ. Again, λί θο ν, ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν oi οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος
ἐγενήθη, Mark xii. 10, similar to the example fromtheOEdipus above, with
the exception that there is nothing to govern λίθον, which is here the
subject of ἐγενήθη, by means of its representative οὗτος. Also, ταῦτα
d daupein ἐλείισονται ἡμέραι ἐν cle οιίκ ἀφεθήσεται λίθος ἐπὶ λίθῳ, Luke
xxi. 6, where ταῦτα stands lor ἐν τούτοις, or for τούτων. In all these
examples, it will be observed, that the attracted word is not in the relative
clanse3 we may also call them instances of anacoluthon, where a structure
is commenced which is not persevered in3 or cases of the accusative
absolute, accusativos praepositivas, or of what is called the Greek accu-
sative. See αῙεο, καὶ γὰρ atri> τοῦτο· οὗπερ αάτὸς ἕνεκα φίλων ᾤετο
δεῖσθαι, ὡς συνεργοδς ἔχοι, καὶ αθτδς ἐπειρᾶτο συνεργὸς τοῖς φίλοις xpri·
πιστος εἶναι τούτου, Xen. Anab. i. 9, 21, where αίιτδ τοῦτο is a fore·
stalling of τοθτον, though not here attracted, as it is in a different case.
One of the editors compares with this our passage, Matt. xii. 36, also
1 Cor. x. 16. 2 Pet. i. 5. Matt. xxi. 42. John vi. 39. Acts x. 36. Eph.
iv. 15.

(e) Relative ιἰι attractioa with the predicate, aad aot tlte real
antecedent. These cases are not of very frequent occurrence.
Thus, σκέψαι δ’ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀγαθῶν οίινν ἀποκλείεις τε κατερύκεις ἣν
δουλείαν οὖσαν ἐ’φασκες καὶ ὑπερεσίαν ἀποδείξειν, Aristoph.
Vesp. 614, ‘but now treat with contempt advantages such as
those you debar me from, if you can, and which you said bnt
now you would prove to be mere slavery and service ε’ τοῦτο δ’
ἐστίν, οὐχ ἣ ν ἀν οὑτωσί τις φήσειεν ἀτιμίαν, Dem. Philipp. Γ.
