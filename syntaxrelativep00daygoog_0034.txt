ἐναντίον ἢ ὁ ποιητὴς ἐποίησεν ὁ ποιήσας, Plat. Euthyphr.12, Αἰ δι’
εὔνοιαν τούναντίον είπες ἢ δύναται, ibid. Phaedr. 275, A, ‘for I
say the opposite of what the poet seigned,' &a 3 ‘the opposite of
what is ita real valna? Among othere, the following good in-
stancee maybe quotedr ὑφ’ ἧς ἐμασχαλίσθη καὶ ἐξίμ αξ ε ν, Soph.
Elect. 437 ι illum epo jare despiciam, coiecit quanto sublimior
Αίίαι omnibuis ιἰι hybla ait ιυσοίὶθιιι, hic tamen idem ίμοοτεί, for
aed qai in the latter clauae, Juven. Sat. xi. 23: μανθάνειν παρὰ
τούτων, ol μήτε προσποιοῦνται διδάσκαλοι εἶναι, μήτ’ ’ἐστι ν αὐτῶν
μαθητὴς μηδεὶς τούτου τοῦ μαθήματος, Plat. Men. 90, Ε; where see
aleo Stallbaum's note to the passage, in which he quotea, Gorg.
452, D. De Republ. iii. 395, D. Ibid vi. 505, E: οία λέγεταί τε
ὑπὸ τῶν ποιητῶν, καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν άγαθῶν γραφέων τά τε ἄλλα ίερᾶ ἡμῖν
καταπεποίκιλται, καὶ δὴ καὶ τοῖς μεγάλοις Παναθηναίοις ὁ πίπλος
μεστὸς τῶ ν τοιούτω ν ποικιλμάτων άνάγεται είς τὴν α’κριίπολιν;
Plat. Euthyph. 6, Β b C, where supply οίσις implied from σία,
and note the change of construction to τοιούτων, instead os ὧν οι
οἵων, see Stallbaum= καὶ νῦν τί χρὴ δρῶν 3 ὅστις ἐμφανῶς θεοῖς
ἐχθαίρομαι· μισεῖ δέ μ’ Ἑλλήνων στρατός, Soph. Aj. 449. 'l'his
example illustratet also the ellipaia of the demonstrative before
ὅστις, and it was, perhaps, with aview to make the real senae clear,
that the writer suddenly reverta to the direct structure, and intro-
ducea με. See also Matth. Gr. Gr. 472, 3. Again, οὐχ’ ὁράᾳς, οίος
καὶ lyd, καλός τε με’γας τε; πατρὸς δ’ εἴμ’ άγαθοῖο, θεά δί με γείνατο
μήτηρ, Hom. Il. φ’. 108. The practice we have been exemplifying
here is very frequent with αὐτός, νίν, μίν; aa, ἢ φάσει μὲν ἦν βασί-
λεια Λαομέδοντος, ἔκκριτον δέ νιν δώρημα κείνῳ ’δῶκεν Ἀλκμήνης
γόνος, soph.Aj.1273: ἐφ’ θ ν ἂν ’ίδρς τὸ πνεῦμα καταβαῖνον, καὶ
μίνον ἐπ’ αὐτὸν, John i. 33: περὶ ὧν διενεχθέντες καὶ οὗ δυνάμενοι
ἐπὶ ἱκανὴν κρίσιν αὐτῶν, Plat. Euthyph. 7, D. And to thia class
belong two examplee quoted above, Hom. Il. π’. lca. τ’. 389.
ln the Greek of the New Testament thie practice is carried atill
further, and the αὐτός actually occure with the relative in the same
clause, of which examplea are given elsewhere. In thia way ia
explained the construction in J olin xv. 6, ‘lfa man abida notin
me, he is cast sorth as a branch, and ie withered3 and men gether
them, and cast them into the fire, and they are bumedz' ὡς τὸ
κλῆμα, καὶ ἐξηράνθη, καὶ συνάγουσιν αὐτὰ, καὶ είς πῦρ βάλλουσι,
καὶ καίεται. Here the αὐτά ia once expressed in the second of l'our
clauses, of which two having the verb in the active, and two in the
passive, the αὐτά serves for both subject and object, the aenae
being certainly, that the branchea are withered, gathered, cast into
