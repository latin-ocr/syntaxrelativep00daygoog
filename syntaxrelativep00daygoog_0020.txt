Oba. l. ln the first of these examples is may be regarded aa wanting,
with the verb belonging to it assumed from thatin the relative clause, for
the relative is in the first ease the subject of currebat, and in the second
offerret. In the second and third instances the relative is no longer
subjective, but objective. The Greek example is otherwise peculiar, by
reason of the expression dv ὁ πράξας for the simple tense of the verb.

2. On the other hand, the neuter form of the pronoun id is very often
found where it appears to be redundant, or is to be regarded as emphatic:
intelligo te id qaod omnes sortes ac boni oiri facere debent, dic. Cic.
Epist. ad Divers. v. 19: in tanto tamqne corrupta civitate, Catilina id
qaod sacta facillimam erat, dic. Sall. in Cat. e. 14: dicere id qaod
res babet; in lacta mortem, dc. ibid. Cat. 51: ceteram id qaod noa
timebant per dolam ac proditionem prope libertas amissa est, Liv. ii. δε
i al qa od in civili caasa hodierno die primam videmus, anam atqne idem
sentientem, Cic. Cat. iv. 9: but in all these and similar instances the
relative is made to precede the clause to which it refers, which is often,
as in the last example, a condition of marked and emphatic importance.
Sometimes when there are two members, id is omitted with the first,
whilst illad is inserted with the second; as, imperinm previas qaodfit
qaam illnd qnod amicitia adjanpitnr, Ter. Adelph. i. l, 41.

3. It was noticed above that we are not, in examples where is is want-
ing, to infer that this was in all cases the intended construction. The
following case seems to prove the contrary; ad qnos non est facile
incentu qni descendat, Cic. de Amic. 17. Here if we suppose is, we
require facilis, as the construction nonest facile inventa eam would
hardly be allowable. It is obvious that the impersonal est facile inventa
is here followed by qai descendat as a direct object.

4. Examples of the ellipsis of the principal subject are much rarer
when the relative is in one of the oblique cases, as in the following: ὃν
γὰρ ἀπέστειλεν ὁ θεὸς, τὰ ῥήματα τοῦ θεοῦ λαλεῖ, John, c. iii. v. 34:
ὃν φιλεῖς, ἀσθενεῖ, ibid. xi. 3: tam erupite senata, triumphans
pandis, qaem omnino vivam illinc eaire non oportuerat, Cic. pro Muren.
25: but this last instance is perhaps not in point, while the subject of
erupit is well known, and the relative clause only contains an emphatic
addition not necessary to the sense—⁶ a man su ch that heought never
to have lest it alive) When, however, the elliptical word is only the
object of the preceding verb, the relative is frequently in one of the
oblique casea, as: ὃν ὁ Πατὴρ ἡγίασε, sai, ἀπέστειλεν εἷς τὸν κόψον,
ὑμεῖς λέγετε, John x. 36.

q 2.-Sometimes the genitive ejas or in Greek αὐτοῦ, or some
other genitive, is wanting. In the following example there is an
ellipsis of sententia ejas, unless any one prefers understanding aliquis
