PRELIMINARY REMARKS.

—-——-

I uusr beg the reader to keep in view, that, in what follows, it is
the doctrine of the Latin subjunctive, as employed in connexion
with the relative and its family of words, that l am chiefly aiming
to elucidata 3 and that although reference will be made to parallel
Greek constructione, this is in accordance with my general design,
by which the two languages are made to illustrate each other. To

have been able to have added any thing new to what hae been so
effectually done in the larger Greek Grammars of Buttmann, Mat-

therefore, throughout these peges, rather to what seemed to me
susceptible of further explanation, in away not as yet exactly
attempted, and also as to which I was sanguine enough to hope l
might add something of practical value. lt hasbeen already noted
at the commeneement, that the whole is to be regarded as a con-
tribution to the department of which it trenta, and it may be added,
that much is professedly left untouched, which would require to be
comprised in a work aiming at systematie completeness‚ and to
exhaust the subject which it embraees.

of the verb, with which it is connected in its own clause3 and
whether there may not be discovered some general and extensive
