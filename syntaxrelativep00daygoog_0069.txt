§.itte-There are other relative forms, as quantus, qualit, quot,
quotus, quum, quarn, answering to fautus, tulis, tot, tofus, tum, tom,
which require to be noticed in this place, and the uses of some of
these will detain us while we examine them rather minutely. The
latter are properly the demonstratives of the former, in the same
way that id is of quod, or eo of quo. We are not, however, to infer
from this, that the demonstrative forms are always followedby
their corresponding relative forms3 nor, ou the other hand, that
the relative are only used in connexion with, or after the demon-
strative. In some, as quotus, all connexion of this kind appears to
have vanished, and its own place is ostener filled by the form quot,
it being more common to say quat nuni than quotus nunus, Hor.
Epist. ad August. 35. This ordinal adjective form is, however,

not unfrequently employed, most commonly, in the singular num-
ber, either agreeing with the subject of the verb, or a substantive ·
' expressed; aa, tu quotus aare velta rescribe, Hor. Ep. i. 5, 30:

ι’. e. what number you with others would wish to make, agreeing
with tu understood. With qualia and quantus, the demonstratives
are much more commonly wanting, and it is the consideration of
these with which we shall principally occupy ourselves, because
like qut in the uses of it before exemplified, they generally take the
antecedent substantive in their own clause. When not used in
similes, qualia and quantus differ principally from qui, in expressing
more definitely the notions of ‘ quality' and ‘quantity,' and qui is
osten used in a parallel signification, particularly in connexion
with one of these.

(a) 'Phe following examples illustrate the use of quamam in one
of its ordinary constructionsr at ut ridere te plane utque unimod-
uertere quantum aquaque proficiscatur appareat, Cic. de
petit. Consul. 62 utque iu tia omuibus yerurr'brujudicato et perpert-
dito quantum quisque poscit, ibid: scire autem oportet quo
quisque auimo stt ut et quantum cuipare considas, ibid.
9. In these quantum corresponds exactly with quid, and is fol-
lowed by the subjunctive, the mark of the objectiva clause, in the
same way. While passing, it may be as well to notice Cicero's

⁷ See Pflugk’s Alcestis.
