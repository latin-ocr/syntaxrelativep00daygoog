Thus we have in Plato αὐτός and ἐκεῖνος used of the same sub-
ject3 ae, ὧν δεόμεθα παρ’ ἐκείνων, ταῦτα αὐτοὺς αἰτεῖν,
Euthyphr. 14‚D. See also Stallbaum’s note to the Phaedon, 106,
B. 111, Β. though possibly this is not much to our purpose.

Oba. Some cases of apposition‚ commonly so called, might be explained
ina similar way. We might, perhaps, include in this way some uses of
the partitives ol δέ, and ἕκαστος, where the word expressing the whole is
first put, followed by the partitive in the same case3 as, δώσω ὑμῖν
ἑκάστῳ, Rev. ii. 23. Δ

§25.—Under this head is presented abundant material sor ex-
amination and arrangement. The most careless reader must have
often noticed some of the many deviations from what may be
regarded as its ordinary construction, which the relative under-
goes, and has experienced, if he has thought at all, a moment’s
difficulty, at least, in reconciling these with its primitive simple
use. He has again and again observed, that, although the relative
does not commonly agree in case with its antecedent, it is, never-
theless, osten joined with a substantive, in full agreement with it
as an adjective, and that it does, in numerous instanees, obtain a
direct interrogative soree, which does not, at first, seem to have
belonged to it. Os these irregularities ⁶, he will naturally seek a

⁶ In using the term ‘irregularity' l do not mean as regards the practice
of Latin writers, but rather in respect to the particular nature of the
relative, considered grammatically. Undouhtedly it would be more correct
to- say, expromeret propere quas insidiarum atti miros per umhopes
jaceret, Liv. ii. 12, than miros expromeret quos; and there are many verbs
in Latin of the active class, which properly take no object but the relative
clause, which in these cases has its own subject. We have seen, however,
elsewhere, that in Greek it is extremely usual in corresponding cases to
make the subject, and even sometimes the object, of the dependent clause,
the direct object of the main verb; and many similar instaures exist in
Latin, though constituting the exception rather than the rule, as just above
in the same chapter of Livy, semet ipse operiret quis ess e t,· but we
should certainly say, multa intersere sario sermore serebant, quem
socium eaeaaimem votes, quod corpus hemardum diceret, Virg. AEn.
vi. 160, not diceret socium quem, or diceret corpas qaod.
