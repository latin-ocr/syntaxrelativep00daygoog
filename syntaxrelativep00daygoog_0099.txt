ote. 1. These examples will illustrate sufficieutly what we have iu
view. Though the relative is in the initial position, and admits of the
proposed substitution, in most of the examples given in this chapter, this
'is not always the ease. In the oblique oration, or after an impersonal, we
find it occupying its usual place, and yet taking this construction. It is
likewise freely used in the oblique oration, in the structure of the accu-
sative and infinitiva, when it is an interrogative, where we cannot apply
the test of substituting for it is and the copula, and this either with or
without a governing verb. We have before seen, that, in its interrogative
use, the relative becomes an adjective, and consequently it takes the cen·
struction of its substantive freely: and in addition to this, it is employed
as the subject to a verb in the infinitive meod, aud its adverbial forms are
likewise employed before verbs in the infinitive meod, without any govem·
ing verb preceding, in what is called the rhetorical question, where no
answer is expected, or where it is analogous to the aecusativus indignantis.
(a) Generned accusative and infinitiva. The following is in point: qn am
paterent continaatoe militiae cansam esse, Liv. v. 2: quem
Dearn si capiat opitulari pesse reipublicae credamne? Cic. pro
Marcell. 7. 23, in finem. (b) Rhetorical or indiynantqaestion. Of these
the following may be named: quern enim bonnm civem secernere sna
a publicis consilia, Liv. iv. 57: qnid jam integri esse in corpere terei
ad aava vulnera accipienda, ibid. iv. 58: qnoe si in repe tem eodem,
ferenda nen faerint, quem laturam in tot privatis, ibid. iii.39,
where also the first qnae illustrates the previous part of this chapter.
(c) Accusatiee and infinitiee rhetoricatur indignant aster interrogative
relative adeerbs. Thus, qni credituros eos, ibid ii. 4: qnid eninr
eos per papirianae e pi s s e, ibid. iii. 39: a nd e enin eam pecaniam confici
posse, ibid. iv. 60, in which arrangemeuts enirn is osten found. The
class of examples mentioned under (b) and (c) is at once rendered intel-
ligible by reference to an analogous principle, viz. the employment of the
subjunctive in questions occurring in the direct oration, where no answer
is expected, in lieu of which in the oblique oration an infinitive is placed
as above.

2. In the same way as the relative, when interrogative, is coustrued
with its noun in the accusative and infinitive, so those relative forms which
properly take a subject in their own clauses, as qualis, quantas, da,
admit of the same construction freely. It will hence happen that qni,
when used for qualis, or something nearly alrin, as we have seen it com-

monly is, if it occurs in connexion with it, is found in this constmetion. ’

(α) construction ⁰f qualis, qe. The examples of this lrind are common
'enouglm dicendam est etiarn qualem hominis honorati et principis deman
placeat esse, Cic. Off. i. 39: a qno ean qacereret Pyrrhus qualern
Romam comperisset (sub. ess e), Eutropium. (b) Qat withqnalis. This
is merely named, to prevent the usage from being confounded with ones
previously brought forward3 as, constituendam est qnos nos et quales
esse velimus, Cic. de Off. i. 32. Here nos and esse are in the structure
of the accusative and infinitive, while quos and quales are qualifying adjec-
tives of the subject nos. It may be objected, that they are predicates
after esse, and they certainly serve this purpose, though we cannot put
them in this arrangement, as they serve the purpose of conjunctione, end
they agree strictly with the subject.

3. In Greek, the use of the relative, in the stnrcture of the accusative
and infinitiva, is sometimes avoided, by omission of the subject accusative,
