at a distance, by intervening clauses, from other words with which it is in
close syntactical connexion, such repetitions are not uncommon. Thus
βάρυνε δέ μιν δόρυ μακρδν ἑλκόμενον, τδ μὲν οὔτις ἐπεφράσατ’, οὐδ’
ἐνόησε μηροῦ ἐξερύσαι, δ ὁ ρ ν μείλινον, ὄφρ’ ε’πιβαίη, Hom. Il. ε’. 664.
And again, by a species of anacoluthon, on the contrary, the relative
is repeated in the demonstrative clause3 as, ταίν δ’ ἅθλίαιν οίιιτραῑν
τε παρθένοιν ε’μαῖν, clv οὔποθ’ ἡμὴ χωρίς ἐστάθη βορᾶς τράπεζ’ ἄνευ τοῦδ’
α’νδρός, ἀλλ’ ὅσων ἐγὼ ψαύοιμι, πάντων τῶνδ’ del μετειχέτην· αίν μοι
μέλεσθαι, Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 1428. Here Wunder assumes πραθῇ μέριμναν
from the preceding connexion ; but l do not see why ταῖν is not govemed
by μέλεσθαι, though the commencing structure has been departed from.
Accordingly Brunclr, on the authority of one MS, read ταῖν in the last
instance for σίν, evidently seeing the difficulty. The redundancy os ὴμίι
with τοῦδ α’νδρίς, leads Nevius and Wunder to imagine the first ἡμή
corrupt, which is perhaps unuecessary; and lastly, we may notice the
implied nominative to μετειχέτην assumed from σίν, illustrating the matters
treated of in the foregoing chapter, an omission not uncommon with ἄλλαῖς
or rather the use of α’λλά explains the absence of the relative, as it rather
marks a direct than a relative construction. This doubling of words may
generally be explained by reason of parenthesis or suspension in many
other cases. Nothing is more common in Greek than to place ἅν near
the commencement of a conditional clause, in which the verb is suspended
for some way on, when the particle is again repeated with the verb. In
these cases the first άν is premised with a view to give the clue to what
construction is about to follow; ao, εἰκότως ἂν τοὺς ἐρῶντας μᾶλλον ἂν
φόβοιο, Plat. Phaedr. 232, C. Thus, in the subjoined example, we have
the pronoun τόν repeated, aster the noun which is govemed by the same
verb has been expressed3 as, ὁ δὲ Σχεδίον μεγάθυμον Ἰφίτου
υ i δ ν, Φωκίηων ὄχ’ άριστον, ὃς e’v κλειτῷ Πανοπῆι οἰκία ναιετάασκε, πολέσσ’
ἄνδρεσσιν α’νάσσων· τδν βάλ’ ὑπὸ κληῖδα μεόην, Hom. Il. ρ’. 306.
Some would here understand a verb to govem Σχεδίον, and regard τόν as
relative ; but this is certainly not correct. The first noun is govemed by
βάλε, but from the verb having been postponed, the pronoun is joined to
it to show the govemment. ln a similar way, two pronouns are found in
one member repeated3 as, ὡς μή μ’ άτιμον, τοῦ θεοῦ γε προστάτην,
οὕτως α’φῇ με, Soph. OEdip. Colon. 1273, where Wunder gives two ex·
amples, brought forward by Reisig, of a similar kind, Aristoph. Equit. 781.
Xen. OEcum. x. 4. These examples strongly confirm'the allowableness
of the cases under the rule⁵. Again, we have double negativas in the
same member3 as, ἄλλ’ οὺχ ὑπὲρ Φιλίππου καὶ ὦν ἐκεῖνος πράττει νῦν,
οὐχ οὕτως ἔχουσιν, Dem. cont. Philipp. Γ. ζ’, unless the οὐκ is here
merely rhetorical. Also, double interrogativas, as, πῶς, ὅτ’ ηὐτύχει
Τροία, πέριξ δὲ πύργος εἶχ’ ἔτι πτόλιν, ἐ’ζη πε Πρίαμος, Ἕκτορός τ’ ἤνθει
δόρυ, τί δ’ ου’ τότε, Eurip. Hecub. 1184. These cases are distinguishable
from others where double negatives and interrogativas are made use of,
being here due solely to parenthesis.

· ³ The same view will explain the syntax of the following: clamor
indiciam primurn fnit, quo res inclinatura esset; excitatior crebriorque
σθ hoste sublatum αθ Rornanis dissonas impar, segnius saepe iteratas,
incerto clamore prodidit pavorem animorum, Liv. iv. 373 nor dol

thinlr there is any need of emendation.
