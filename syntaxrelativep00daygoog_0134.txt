Gaul! ln the next example, suisset marks the reason assigned by Cato's
enemies, not by Cicero. And in the last example, though the writer here
speaks himself, yet he is held to be a distinet party from the historian,
it being a mere accident that the historian aad speaker are the same

2. There are some apparent violatione of this rule. (a) Where we
must suppose that the writer is throwing in an explanation of his own,
similar to what would be assigned by the other party, and therefore marked
as such by the indicative. (b) ln certain mere circumlocutione, as ea
tltttttttttt impituslttttttttmt. tttttttit‘lttt
a word might be coiied so as io conainythe whole dorion, were it necessary.
(a) Where the allusion is to a recorded fact, even though it is introduced
not as a statement of the writer, but as containing a part of the thought or
sentiment of another person. Zumpt is of opinion, however, that the
occurrence of the indicative in these instances is not in keeping with striet
Latinity, but that they must be regarded as inadvertencies of the writers,
which are not to be imitated. In the two cases quoted by him, se haud
malta post, quom pestilentia in urbe suerat in juvenuttem grassantem in
Subura incidisse, Liv. iii. 13: lepator nuntiare jussit, Q. Fabium consulem
AEquia bellum afferre eadem dextra armata, paam pacatam illia antea
dederat, ibid. iii. 2, it appears to me that the ‘year of the pestilente,'
and ‘the peace made by Fabius‚’ forming a part of the Roman armals,
might wilth strict propriety be referred to in the indicative if the writer so
preferre .

b 81.-1t is in this way that the subjunctive is so common with
the relative aster an accusative and infinitiva 3 because the relative
clause in this oblique oration then so osten contains the sentimenta
of the person who is the subject of the infinitiva, who is of course
not the writer. The two last examples in the preceding b 80 are in
point, to which I may add, omnnem Lacedaemoniorum pue subducto
esset, Cic. Off. iii. ll: perutile esse amentiam quod ilremiatocles
offerret, ibid: ibi fama est in quiete meum ab eo juvenem diuina
macie, qui se ab Jaae diceret mireum, Lir. xxi. 22, ‘so the report
said? puae dua diaerm mario amplectantur, ibid. xxi. 30:
eos ι’]ιιοι quos cernant, ibid: aon se eaiatimare Βοιιιοιιοι sine
ope diuina bellum perere; qui tanta altitudime machinationes tanta
celeritate promouere possent, Caes. B. G. ii. 313 but this may
also be explained by the next article, as the qui has here also some-
thing approaching to the eausal force. Itis not, however, merely
because the relative clause contains the thought or sentimenta os
the speaker, after an accusative and infinitiva, that the subjunctive
is used, but because also the case put by the speaker is awholly
general one, and does not refer definitely to any party. Thus, ad
duc Ariouistus respondit; jas esse delli ut qui vicissent iis
quaa uicissent, quemadmodum vellem, imperarent, caes. B. G.
i. 36, ‘that any persons who conquered should have the rule of
