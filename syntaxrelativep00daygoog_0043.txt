Obs. Nearly allied to this is the subjoined construction, 111 which it is
the relative clause, however, that appears to be redundant: 0111οῦ τὰ
σημεῖα d ἐποίει, John ii. 23. v· 36. vi. 2. 3 Ep. John i. 10: and again,
τὰ ἔργα σον d ποιεῖς, John vii. 3. Gen. ii. 2. But this construction
admits 01 explanation on another principle, aud is analogous to another
very common practice of the Greeks, viz. the removing the subject out of
the subordinate relative clause, and putting it 01 the direct object to
averb 01 other word preceding it, whose proper object is, according to
Latin and English practice, the whole relative clause. See my Aecus.
and Infin. chap. iv. p. 33. So Κρέοντος, 0111 μοι βεβουλενκὼς ἔχε ι,
Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 674, in answer to ὅτου πράγματος μῆνιν τοσήνδε ἔχεις,
where Creon is taken from 111 own clause, aud put answering to πράγματος,
111 11011 01 πραγμάτων understood. Thus, 111 the case above, the natural
construction would be τὰ σημεῖα d αὐτὸς ἐποίει. 11111011 01 which, corde is
made to depend on σημεῖα, 01 the latter 01 two substantives, precisely as
in the following English example, formed exactly on the Graecian model,
the verb takes the subject 01 the relative clause for its object, with the
remainder 01 the clause in apposition, instead 01 the whole clause as au
object; ‘then you perceive the body 01 0111 kingdom, how foul
it is,' Shakesp. ll. Henry 1v. act iii. sc. l, for ‘then you perceive how
foul the body 010111 kingdom is τ’ τὸν d i Λάϊον φύσιν τίν’ εἶχε φράζε,
11νο δ’ ἀκμὴν ἥβης ἔχων, OEdip. Tyr. 713, ‘tell Laius what nature 110 11011,’
101 ‘tell what sort 01 person Laius was ;’ and note 0110 that ἔχων follows
the construction understood, and not that expressed. Some supposed
cases 01 anacoluthon might be explained in this way. Imay remark, in
passing, that not merely the subject, but even the object 01 the dependent
relative clause is sometimes removed in this way ς as, Πάνδαρον ἀντί-
θεον διζὴμενος, ei που ἑφεΰροι, Hom. Il. e'. 168: 101 cdxlv δέ

. 111ογ be regarded 01 redundant 01 exegetical. Sometimes 1110 opposite to

this takes place, particularly with certain uses of quis 01111111, where
a dative is transferred from the preceding verb to the relative clause, 01
which it then becomes the subject3 as, sednon ante datur telluris operto
subire auricomos qaam qais decerpserit arbore foetus, Virg. AEn. vi. 140,
10111011 datur alicui quom decerpserit, where the dative to datur becomes
nominative to decerpserit; but falling in this position aster quam, the
unaccented form of the word is 01011111. quis, according to usage after
other relative forms. This is, perhaps, properly a Greek structure, as,
Ἕλληνι 1101 βαρβάρῳ πορεύεσθαι, ὅπη 1 ις ἤθελεν, Α1101). 1. 9,13, 1011111
Ἑλλήνων. 111 some other instantes it happens, that the subject of the
relative clause is made, not the object, but the subject of the preceding3
aa, ei τὰ μὲν χρήματα λυπεῖ τινὰς ὑμῶν εἶ διαρπασθήσεται, Dem.
pro Cher. ιγ’. We can, however, explain this last example, in accordance
with another principle extensively prevalent in Greek, whereby usages
