2. There is a curione confusion af structure which sometimes occurs, in
which the transferente of the genitive plural into the relative clause takes
place, while the substantive an which it depends in the antecedent clause
is expressed. Thus, securus amarum qui juvenum tihi semper meat,
Virg. AEn. x. 326. I have little doubt but that the genitive plural is here
really dependent on qui, but still not in a partitive sense, ‘indifferent to the
laves which (loves af youths) were always entertained far thee.’ Sa also
cam legatis donaque qai captivarum remissi ad suas sacrant mayoc
circumfusa multituda veuit, Liv. ii. 22. Here captivarum requires
to be made dependent an multituda, to make good the ordinary construc-
tion, but it is transferred to qai, and this is further confirmed by the gender
af qui being determined by captivarum rather than multituda.

3. Sometimes in Greek the genitive, where it may depend an the subject
of the leading verb, is necessarily made ta depend on the relative, because
that subject is unexpressed3 ae, σφῷν d'dre'ra’, οὓς μὲν εἰκὸς ἦν
πονεῖν τάδε, κατ’ οἶκον airaupaulein, ὥστε παρθένοι, OEdip. Col. 338.
Here σφῷν must be made to depend on οὓς, aad then the whole relative
clause assumed as subject to οἰκουροῦσιν, but the usage may be explained
by supposing that the subject of οἱκουροῦσιν is elliptical, an which σφῷ ν
de ends.

ii. ln English, in interrogative sentences, we make use of two construc-
tions: ‘ What man do you mean l’ or ‘which of the persons is itl’ The
first employs ‘what’ as an adjective in agreement with the naun ‘marn'
the second answers to the partitive construction of Latin and Greek.

5. Instead of the partitive construction, ὁ μέν, ὁ δέ, ἕκαστος, are fre-
quently used in apposition with the principal subject3 as, καὶ ὅσοι τνραν-
νεῐν ἐπιχειρήσαντες, ai μὲ ν ababa, κ. τ. λ. Xen. Cyrop. i. l, where, as in
other instantes, αὐτῶν is put in to represent the real construction that is
ordinarily employed, ar contains the ordinary construction. Sa N ε ara·
pidet d’ ὁ μὲν adrua' Ἀτύμνιον ὀξέι δουρὶ.. ..Μάρις δέ, Ηοῐη. Il.
π’. 317 : οὗτοι ἄρ’ ἡγεμόνες Δαναῶν ἔλον ἄνδρα ἕκαστος, ibid. 351:

χώραν . . . . τὴν μὲν . . . . τὴν δὲ δέδωκε, Demosth. de Halonesi. ι’.

d 57.—The relative is put itself in the genitive plural aster par-
titives, in accordance with the rule, that the relative takes all the
constructione of the demonstrative pronaum as equivalent ta it and
the copulative conjunction3 as, quarum qua est pulcherrim a
Deiapeiarn, Virg. AEn. i. 72. But with the adjectivae medius, sin-
gulas, reliquas, plerusque, plurimus, multas, and probably same
others, this partitive construction is commonly avoided 3 as, quas
ille plerasque citavit, Nep. in Dat. 9: qaas angulas, Caes.
B. G. i.4ssr quas plurimas edidit, Liv.ii.43= quibus sia-
ga lis dederat imperia, Nep. in Mitte: lingua Gallicae scientiam
qua multa utebatur, Caes. Β. G. i. 47.
