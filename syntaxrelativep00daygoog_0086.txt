Ter. Adelph. ii. 8, 9. Hor. Sat. i. 10, 21, in which its force appedrs

almost evanescent. Thus, in Greek, we meet with αὑτοῦ usually opposed
to ἐνθάδε, coupled with it redundantly, as τοῖς ἐνθάδ’ αὑτοῦ, OEdip. Col. 78.
So in the English Prayer-Book version of the Psalms, ‘what time as the
storm fell upon thee,’ where one of the expressions, ‘what time' or ‘as,’
is redundant: but in another point of view thia example better belongs to
the illustration of the next chapter.

10. Several peculiar examples, taken from English, illustrating some of
the points referred to in previous parts of this treatise, may with propriety
be introduced here, though not wholly belonging to this chapter. ‘ What
is thy name, that in the battle thus thim crossest mel' Shak. Ι. Hen. tv.
v. 3, where the construction implied is, ‘what is the reason l’ but assigning
the name would assign the reason. In the following a preposition is
omitted: ⁸ unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke, my soul consents not
to give sovereignty’ (to), ibid. Midsum. Night’s Dr. i. 1: ‘whom heavens
in justice, both on her and hers, have laid most heavy hand,’ ibid. Cymbel.
where ‘ on’ is to be assumed from the exegetical clause : ‘what conjura-
tione, and what mighty magic, I won his daughter’ (with), Othello to the
Senate. See Knight's Pictorial Shakspere. In other cases in English
aller the preposition, the ellipsis even of the relative itself is so usual, that
its insertion, as in the following, sounds awkwardly: ‘a little time before
th at our great grandsire Edward sicked and died,’ ibid. II. Hen. IV. iv.
4, the ‘that’ being here the Latin eam, not the demonstrative pronoun.
ln similar instantes, ‘that' is usudly omitted. An instance of ellipsis
occurs in the following: ‘how Ι came hythe throne, O God, forgive,’ ibid.
ll. Hen. lV. iv. 4: ‘ till when let us suffer and wait,' Beaum. and
Fletch. Maid's Tragedy, ii. 1, where ‘how’ has the force of ‘the manner
in which,' and ‘when' is put for ‘which time.⁸

as the examples will best speak for themselves, l shall merely
quote such as I have at hand, observing on them where necessary
as l proceed.

(a) Gompoend relative words. We have already seen, that the
Latin language contains a number of words of this kind, and that
this doubling gives to the relative in many cases an indefinite
force. Of these are quisquis, quicunque, quanquam, quantus quantus,
ubi nbi, qualis qualis, quantuscunque, quotuscunque, quotusquisque,
ubicunqne, qualiscunque, tyn, and the Greek ὅστις.

Ohs. ln Homer, ὅστις occurs definitely for dc: as, ob μὰ Ζῆν’, ὅστις τε
θεῶν ὕπατος καὶ ἄριστος, ll. ψ’. 43, where Jupiter is expressly named. ln

the same way it is put immediately aster rte: as, ἔστι τις ὅστις oleras, .
