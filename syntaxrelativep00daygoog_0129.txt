substantive, in agreement with the relative as an adjective, in its
own clause, of which we have brought forward so many instances
in the previous part of this work. Under this head are included
adverbial combinatione, as quopccto, quomodo, quemadmodum, quom-
obrem, qucre, tyr. The following are examplesr qaid sentirent
operuerunt, Nep. iu Eum. 131 ostendam trenam qaid 111 pericli fot-
Iere, Ter. Andr. v. 2, 261 notura quid efficere possit videtur asperto,
Nep. in Alcib. 1: docet quo res sit, cic. de petit. Consul. 111

3: videamur quatenus amor debeat, Cic. de Amic. ll. 351 ridetis

1111111 tum intelligitur quom inopes firmat, ibid. 15. 531 sani
1111111 1111111111 hebetaretur, Cels. ii. 181 quc 1111111111 det 1111111
videmus, Virg. AEn. iii. 584: pacarit quitus locis sit Aspis, Nep. in
Dat. 4. Sometimes, however, aster verbs of esking, the ipsissimo
cerdo of the speaker are given3 as, 11 quia 1111111 querat qao 1111111
pertinet? Hor. I. sat. ii. 23. Hence all indirect questions require
the verb in the subjunctive, ie. whenever the question, instead of
being directly asked, is dependent on a foregoing verb. Con-
sequently, in an indirect question, 91111, quid, 1111111, quantas, quot,
quatis, cur, quare, ott, unde, uter, quo, utrum, 111, ne, 1111111, take the
subjunctive.

(1) By a reference to the former part of this work it will be
seen, that 1 have treated this use of a substantive in the relative
clause as a transference out of the demonstrative clause3 and such
was, no doubt, the origin, or, at all events, we can explain the matter
syntactieally in this way. I do not thereby mean to bave it under-
stood, that the idiom of the language would allow the replacement
of this transferred noun, or that it can with any pmpriety be
generally allowed. v'l'his is, on the contrary, one principal method
by which the Latius distinguish an objectiva clause from a merely
explanatory one, and the few deviatione that occur are accordingly
marked as exceptions3 such as, damnatum penam sequi oportebat
111 tyni cremaretur, Caes. B. (1.1411 1111111 at 11111 optarat, Ter.
Adelph. v. 4, 201 scine me 111 quidm 91111111 sim, Ter. Eunuch. v.

8, 5: codice 111 illum qaid cit, ibid. v. 8, 71 sce me 111 edom, ibid.
Heaut. i. 1, 321 qai eius foratam cognoscere 1111111111 quotis 11111,

word to be used in objectiva sentences, or with the subjunctive. Thus,
atque 1111111 illud ipsum, qaod acerbitatis 1111111 objurgatio, signifi-
candum 111, Cic. Off. i. 38, where the indicative iamed, because the

clause is explanatory of the subjectÍ¾ but ostendam qui d 111 pericli, see
above, where the quid 11111 objectiva.
