place of, and as equivalent to their precursors. 'l'he convenience
of the vowel-endings, in the'second person of verbs, is manifest
enough in poetry, and the same is true of the third perfect plural,
though common enough in prose. But even if my notion of quis
here advaneed, is maintained, principally, to bear out a particular
theory, one thing is clear, that qaid is preferred to quod in a
strictly objectiva clause, where the subjunctive is joined with it,
while quod is almost as invariably used in the mere explanatory
clause, and the specific distinction of the two ia determinately
marked.

κ §we-From what has been said, then, it is easy to see, that in
the use of qai interrogative, the antecedent is transferred into the
clause and case of the relative, and that in the other class of ex·
amples, we must either regard the relative as a demonstrative in
disguise, or as transferred into the clause and case of the ante·
cedent, as in the following illustratione of its uae, in the structure
of the ablative absolute3 quibus rebrat consectis, Caes.; quo sacto,
ibid, ‘whichthings having been finished,’ ‘which having been
done? These stand, respectively, for iis rehtu quus diei confectis,

’ and eo facto quod dirimas, if we take the latter view.

t 30.—Thus may he explained the uses of the common adverbial
expressions, quo poeto, quo numero, quomodo, quemadmodum, qaam-
obrem, amad, quousque, quare, quapropter, quotenus, δια, which are
used as relative conjunctione, in order to connect a preceding verb
with some dependent clause.

ξ 3l.—ln the same way is explained the use of qui admirative,
in which it approaches closely to the force of plantus ; as, ader
vero dii boat quo splendore est, Cic. de petit. Consul. 2, which
might he rendered videta‘spmdorem quo est. Again3 Oqui
complemus et quadie quanto firmat, Hor. Sat. i. 5, 43, and it
is very probable that, in this way, the method of using ortulis and
quantus has arisen, expressing, however, the notion of quality and
quantity more distinctly than the qm' form.

§tiz-There are other forms, as quisquis, prismae, quicquum,
quicunque, quidam, aliquia, quanam, quapiam, which in their uses
differ more widely from the general analogy. These appear to ‚
he connected with quia the indefinite. 'l'he first ia formed on
the analogy of ὅστις, and quicunque and aliquis are often expressed
by ai quis. 'lo these may be added the compounds quivis, qai-
libet, and siquis, written aa one word. The formation and ending
of the first-named of these seems to be somewhat arbitrary, but
they all answer to various uses of the Greek, τις, τὲς, ὅστις, im·
