rules for composition, based on the practice of the best and purast
writers in that particular tongue. In general, the examples here
furnished will speak for themselves 3 those chosen from writers of Α
the purest period will be of greatest authority, and the frequency
with which those of a given kind occur will supply another test of
their value. No one at all conversant with the ordinary rules for
composition will be in danger of attempting to engrast Homeric or
Pindaric forms on pure Attio prose, or to regard some rare poetic
combinations, even of the golden age of literature, as the best
model for the same species of writing. In each particular style of
composition, the leading writers in that style may of course be
safely imitated, where examples are tolerably frequent. It would
appear that rules respecting construction have in many cases, and
by many authors, been laid down too stringent-ly3 and that these
are best inferred from a sufficiently large and well-chonen body of
examples set before the student. I have here merely to add, that
a great number of cases of parallel Greek and Latin construction
will be quoted, in which the latter appear to be a direct imitation
of the former, not properly belonging to the language in which
they are found, either graces or affectation of style insensibly
acquired and adopted, from the study of, or devotion to Greek
originals, or pedantioally intended to display an acquaintance with
the same. These will be carefully noticed as we proceed.

I shall here say nothing of the relative as employed ordinarily,
since the present work can only be of use to such as, having made
some elementary progress in the classica, are desirous of pushing
their inquiries beyond the sphere of a rudimentary grammar,
though by no means requiring previously high attainments for its
profitable use. 'Phe whole may be regarded rather as a classifi-
cation of important and singular uses of the relative3 some of
them, however, common enough, but still bearing on the illustra-
tion of those that are less frequent, and standing at the basis of
the subject. Out of these will arise observatione towards the
deduction of a complete system and theory of the relative and its
cognates, rather than aformal statement of the same, which, in
the present stage of the inquiry, it would be unadvisable to attempt.
The materials for such a complete plan are as yet by no means
brought together into one place. Let us hope that it admits of
accomplishment, and in the mean time let this collection of exam-
ples be regarded only as a contribution to so desirable a result.
