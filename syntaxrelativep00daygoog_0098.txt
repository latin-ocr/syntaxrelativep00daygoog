tration the following: qai juvenes, quantas ostentant, aspice,
vires, Virg. AEn. vi. 771.

(i) With another demonstrative in its own member. This kind of
usage shows convincingly that the relative is really equivalent to
whatlhaveaimed to show it to be. Thus, qua ne monstra
pii paterentur ta lia moa, Virg. AEn. vii. 21.

(J) In tlte constmction af tlte causative and infinitior. What has
just been noticcd above, leads us very naturally and obviously to
this head. The English language does not admit such an arrange-
ment, and even in Latin the introduction of the relative is, in a
general way, the signal for an instant change from thc oblique to
the direct structure. Still the relative is used very frequently in
this way, in cases where its place may always be supplied with the
demonstrative pronoun and copula, thus making it evident that it
takes the demonstrative construction. At the ontset, however, the
pupil must be cautioned against confounding the use of the relative
in the accusative, coupled with an impersonal verb and an infi-
nitive, with that structure which we are now discussing3 as for
example in the following, stant qnos cordeyisse jurat, Hor. Od. i. 1, 3,
where conlegisse is the subject of the impersonal verb janai, and
quos isthe objectos the same verb. But in those which l shall now
quote, the case is different: quem non incidere mamfestefatsam
est, Celsi praelat: quos eo nihil tentasse judico, ibid.: qnos
sibimetipsos conscisse mortem satis creditam est, Liv. iv. 51:
quas petere consulatum insimulabant, ibid. iv. 55: quern auc-
torem aliquot annis ante fu isse memoratum, ibid. v. 32 de quidm
quoniam satis dictant putamus, nan incommodam ridetar non preterire
Hamilcarem el Hannibalem, qu os et animi maynitadine et calliditate
omnes in Africa natas prestitisse canstat, Nep. in Reges, 3.
Here we cannot actually substitute et eos sor qnos, but the con-
struction is the same as if the demonstrative had beeu used. This
construction is more common with impersonals‚ as will be seen

after falsam est above, cmrstat in this example, and indicio fiat just.

below. Again, postrema at nou solnm anribm acciperetur, sed
etiam oculis cerneretur, quem et ea quanto rayno ad qaam fortunam
detmrsisset. Post Dionysii decessum cum Iceta bellavit, qai adaer-
satas yirerat Dionysio, quem nan odio tyrannidis dissensisse
sed cupiditate in dicio fni t, qaodiyrse, sanaim mannam imperium
dimittere noluit, Nep. in Timol. 2. I have quoted the first part of
this paragraph, as it illustrates in addition the accumulation of
relatives in the same member. Again, fabula quem mnarum
ynete viaisse firnata inducit, Hor. Sat. i. 2, 21, where induco is
put in the secondsry sense of ‘representing ι’ si, quem aquam
est sacere, is benefacit, Ter. Adelph. ii. 3, 2.
