the wane, or, what is the same thing, it is on the road towards
becoming adverbial‚ or a mere conjunction. Thus, quodsi is
nane nte deceperit sepe obsecrans me, at amiam, frustra ocant, Ter.
Heaut. iv. 4, 2. lt is this use of the neuter pronoun for all cases,
which explains the rule for neuter verbs, which are said to take an
accusative of the neuter pronoun after them.

§39.-But these examples do not present cases of ‘ Anacolu-
thon' at all3 the fact being, that in all of them, the relative be-
comes the subject or object to the verb in the conditional clause,
or, as in the last, belongs to some other part os the construction.
'l'he relative occupies the initial position, because the same subject
or object has been the subject or object of what has immediately
preceded3 but the sentence is, in fact, a new one, and is only the
direct construction in arelative dress 3 in other words, the pro-
noun is pronoun and conjunction, and the construction is that of
the demonstrative. In the instance, qaam qai adeptus erit, the
qaam is objective to adeptam in several of the others the qai is
subjective to the conditional clause. A number of instances of
this sort are given by Kriigcr, vol. ii. 242. This author treats
them under the head of a kind of ⁶ Attraction,' by which the rela-
tive knits itself into the construction of the Vordersate (qai adeptus
erit) or protasis, instead of pairing off with the Nacdeate (a nobie
diligetur) or epodosis; and he quotes Pope‚ as cited by'Wagner,
‘Friend to my life, which did not you prolong‚ The world
had wanted many an idle song? It is in consequence os this
demonstrative construction, that the relative does not always
require to be the subject of the verb in its own clause, but a new
subject is introduced3 as, adde queis damm sibi dolect cetura
negatis, Hor. Sat. i. 1, 75. See observation, page 57, of my
‘ Accusative and Infinitive! Here we have first ellipsis, then the
relative in the construction of the ablative absolute, and a new
subject to therelative clause; the relative still acting the partos
conjunction in connecting adde with the verb in the subordinate
clause, doleat. Even with the relative in the nominative, it would
appear, that anew subject was sometimes introduced3 as, ire medio
qai scripto foro recitent, sant matti, quique lavantes: mooe
decen voci resonat conclusas, Hor. Sat. i. 4, 74. Here there¹ is no
coherence of structure between the former and latter partos the
sentence, according to the ordinary mode of viewing it. By the
way in which the editors punctuate the sentence, they would make
the latter part of the sentence, suave acar, aa, independent of
what goes before. I should much prefer the removal of the colon
aster tacentes, and the substitution of a comma, or the entire
