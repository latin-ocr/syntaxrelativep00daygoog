riam, secl tribuniciam potestatem incisam intolerandamque facere, qnam
pacatam reconciliatamque Patribus de intepro in antiquo
redi ρι’ mala, Liv. iii. 9, foret eam redipi. This accusative is here
strongly analogous to the accusativus indipnantis.

(b) Wloere tlte relative commences α period generally ⁸. This
division includes not only the cases in (a), but such as may have
the relative in the initial position under any other circumstances3
as, qu em dnm speculatur, odorentur ejas causa capnoscitur, Nep. in

Dat. 4: quem procul Aspis campiniam adse ferentem pertimescit, ’

ibid: qao celeritate qnam mopnam benevolentiam consecutus esset,
ibid. 5: quornm simul alba nantis stella refulsit defluit sanis
epitatus tumor, Hor. Od. i. 2, 29: cuj us competitores si nibil deli-
querant dipnitati eorum concessit cum petere destitit, Cic. pro Muren.
27. 57 ι qni bns nibil infractus ferar Appii animus quum, tyc. Liv.
ii. 59: a quibas perlatus ad primos tumultus eo pavore ordines
turbavit ut, ὅρα. ibid. This kind of examples includes every case
of the pronoun either with or without a proposition.

Obs. In Greek writers the relative form, for the demonstrative αιίτός
and copula, is used with much greater freedom‚ even where no antecedent
has been used to which it can be immediately referred ς as, τὸ γὰρ βραχύ
τι τοῦτο πᾶσαν ὑμῶν ἔχει τὴν βεβαίωσιν καὶ πεῖραν τῆς γνώμης. οἷς εί
ξυγχωρὴσετε καὶ ἄλλο τι μεῖζον εὐθυς ἕπιταχθίισεσθε, Thucyd. i. 140:
ἀθυμίαν τε πλείστην ὁ χρόνος παρεῖχε, παρὰ λόγον ἐπιγιγνόμενος, οὓς
ρ’ίοντο ἡμερῶν ὀλίγων ἐκπολιορκήσων, ἐν νήσῳ τε ἐρήμῃ, καὶ ὕδατι ἁλμυρῷ,
χρωμένους, ibid. iv. 26. Now, in the Latin examples, the relative has
immediate reference to some preceding subject lately expressed, and here
in these Greek passages it may, like οὗτός, τοίου to a distant antecedent,
vvhich is not the case, so far as Ι am auare, in Latin. In the first of the
examples quoted above, οἷς stands for καὶ εἰ αὐτοῖς, and in the second for
ἐπεὶ αὐτους ᾤοντο, dnm illos putauerunt eapnpnare, though something more
is here implied by the relative, viz. ‘seeing they were men in a desert
island‚' διο. The relative in Greek has very osten no reference to the
subject last named. Several examples of this occur in the Choruses of the
Phoenissae. The gender‚ in these cases, frequently determines the ante-
cedent. I am not prepared to essert that this is never the case in Latin,
but I have no example in prompta. Imay quote the two following from
Greek: ἔμαθον ε’νυπνιον ὀμμάτων ἐμῶν ὄψιν, οίι με παρέβα φάντασμα
μελανόπτερον cir είσιδον, Eurip. Hecuh. 691: ἢ ἐρίφοισι σίνται, ὑπὲκ
μήλων αἱρεύμενοι, alr’, Hom. Il. π’. 352, agreeing with ἐρίφοισι in
gender.

(c) In tbe construction of tbe oblativa absolate, ond otberporentbetie
formula. Thus, qna celeriter assecta primam Corcyraeos fregit,

³ 1 have noticed already, § 21. Obs. 4, some cases of confused structure,
⁸ which show the real nature of the initial qni.
