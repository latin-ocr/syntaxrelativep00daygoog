the subjunctive, or the accusative and infinitive, according as the accusative
of the person or thing is employed. However, in English, we should also
translate monet ut uitet by ‘he advises that he should shun,' aud hence
nitet may be regarded as a potential. Ut in the sense of ‘iu order that:
is also usually rendered by potential signs in English. But in many of its
other uses, after adeo, ita, tantus, dc. itis otherwise.

Relatiue clause not oh’ective.

j ta-The rule contained in the last article will require exami-
nation, before it can be correctly understood, or otherwise it will
seem to contradict fact ; for wherever the prououn is objective is
elliptieal before the relative clause, the latter may be said to fill its
place, and does therefore iu a sense become objective3 yet scores of
instances of this sort may be found where no subjunctive follows.
Thus,onper literas apere pure sopitos, Nep. in Con.3: quod
facere uoluit effecmet, Cic. pro Sext. 38. 81: spone, qui, qnod
dici potuit, non uicerim, Cic. pro Plancio, 34. 85 ε postquam quse
uetuerat dtasrut,Nep.in Lysa: ut qnod velcmpmtsvet leet
vel studii ratio detrabit cura restituat, Cels. i. 2. And thus
perpetually in all writers. See also instances quoted by me, under
the head of Ellipsis, and elsewhere in the body of this work. On
the other hand, where the assumption that isis elliptieal does not
explain the whole proposition, the subjunctive does then very
commonly follow the relative, as in the example given in illus·
tration oft 74. If the relative clause, though occurring after a
verb, merely expresses the place or mannen—in other words, if it
occupies the situation rather of a qualifying adverb than of an
object, it is then not regarded as objective3 aa, sumpsere anm
cuique monimum fuit, Liv. iii. 27: quoquo modo potuimus nutinnimus,
Cic. Amic. 12. 41. It is not uncommon to meet with the explana-
tory aud objectiva clause both following the same verb, asin the fol·
lowing instance, where an examinatiou of the passage will at once
point out the distinction: sed, quod mepta ud nos pertinet et
nescire matum est, apttumus: utrumne diuitiis homines an sint
virtute beuti, Hor. Sat. ii. 6, 72.

(a) ln point of fact, it matters not at all to the use of the sub-
junctive, whether the demonstrative prououns, bic, ille, a's, are
omitted or inserted, the prououn being osten put in by way of
emphasis, as we have elsewhere seen. Thus, neque enim est itt
cature quidquid reticeas, sed cum quod tu scius id
tpnorure emolumenti tui consu uelis 'eos quorum intersit id scire,
Cic. de Off. iii. 13: sed epo boc meis ponderibus eauminubo, non
sotum quid cuique debeam, sedetiam quid cujusque intersit,
