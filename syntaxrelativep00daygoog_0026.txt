stands for the ablativa, in the structme of the ablativa absolute 2-
parto, quod urebas, Hor. Sat. i. 1, 94, ‘ what you desired having
been obtained? nouos ritus eacrrficandiaatieinando, in f e r e n ti bus
in mmor, quibus questui sunt eapti superstitione
aniani, Liv.iv.30, ‘those to whom the superstition ofothers
is a matter of gain, introducing new rites of sacrifice, by
assuming the prophetie character ε’ auctoribus qui aderant ut
sequeretur, Liniitm, ‘tho se who were present sugge stingz’
insuper increpante qui vulneraverat, Liv. iv. 50, ‘he who
had wouuded him add ing thereto reproaeh ε’ qai Atheniensium
rebar studuissent ejectis, Nep.in Lysand. 1, ‘the partinens

Ι of the Atheniens having been banisheds' emptis per

commercia, quorum babitus et crines in captivorum speeiem for-
marentur, Tac. Agric. 39, ‘persons whose dress, &a had been
made to represent that of captives, having been bought in
the way of trade :' remissis qui in prasidio mant, Sall. Bell. Jug.
58: reuocantibus qui rescindebant, Liv. ii. 10: recepto quod
non simut esses, catera betas, Hor. Ep. i. 10, 50, ‘iu every respect
happy, save in your absence ι’ sed mibi opus erat, ut aperte
tibi nnnc subtiler, aliquantulumque afferret, qui dissolverem
qua debeo, Ter. Phorm. iv. 3, 50, ‘ hut that, to talk openly with
you, I wanted a wife who would bring a little ready money, to
enable me to pay my debts.'

Obs. The last example, it will be observed, differs from those which
precede it. All the restare cases of the construction of the ‘ablative
absolute‚' which appear to be of the most frequent occurrence. Thelast
quoted is one of the ablativa aster opus, and belongs therefore to another
rule in syntax.

b 6.—Ellipsis occurs with other words besides the demonstrative
pronoun, and it is sometimes necessary to supply a preposition in
addition. lt thus happens that a verb will sometimes appear to
take as an object one which does not properly belong to it 3 as
stertimus, indomitum quod despumare Falernum subfieiat, Pers.
Sat. iii. 3, ‘we snore lon g enough to dissipate the sumes and
ferment of strong Falernian,' where we must understand per
tempus: again, palleat inseiis, quod prosimu nesciat uuor? ibid. iii.
43, ‘ and unhappy should grow pale with terror, on account
of that which the wife of his bosom may not know,' where we
must understand propter id: veruntamen illis imperatoribus laus
est tribuenda quod eperunt· uenia danda quod relique-
runt, Cic. pro leg. Manil. 3, where supply de eo: ἀγλαΐζεται δὲ
