Attraotion, in ploce of ue Nominotire. l have placed thus under
a distinct head, a few exemplifications of this sort, because they
are wholly at variance with the spirit of the Latin tangue. Thus,
οὗτοι δ’ ἔλεγον ὅτι πολλοὺς φαίη Ἀριαῖος εἶναι Πέρσας ἑαυτοῦ
βελτίους, οὓς οὐκ ἂν dcccxi σθαι αὐτοῦ βασιλεύοντος,
Xenoph. Anab. ii. 2, 1, ‘that there were many Persians his betters,
who would not endure his rule,' where, in Latin, the relative
must have been in the nominative, and the verb in the potential
mood. Again‚ nol ppo οὐδὲν αὐτῶν ὅτι οὗ σχῆμα elvor,Plat.
Men. 74, D. Two or three good instances of this kind occur,
Xen. Cyr. i. 4, 25. Plnt. Protag. 323, Β. and Thucyd. iii. 39.
These are quoted by Kriiger in his work on Attraotion, but not
with this view. Imay remark, that the merisative and infinitivo
is common enough with ὅτι, of which 1 have quoted examples in
my 'lheatise on the Accusative and Infinitive, page 523 and
Stallbaum, in his note to Phaedon, 63, C, assigna a reason for this
use ol' ὅτι with the infinitiva. To this might be added the use of
ὅτι with the participle, in this passage: βλέπω τοὺς ἀνθρώπους, ὅτι
ὡς δένδρα ὁρῶ περιπατοῦντας, Mark viii. 24, only that the con-
fusion is here somewhat more complicated.

Besides the use of the interrogative relative adjective, with an
oblique case os the demonstrative pronoun, in the same agree·
ment and government with it, as mentioned above, there is a
further peculiarity in examples of this sort. 1 quoted above,

ὤμων piperem Lucina, Char. & Mero, for τίνες ἐκείνοι οὓς. Is
ἐκεῖνος were lest out, the construction would be os the ordinary
kind3 but the peculiarity is the introduction of a demonstrative
pronoun in the same case ns the interrogative, thus melting what
would be two distinct clauses in another language into one3 but
in addition to this, the case oi the interrogative itself, where no
verb occurs inita own member to govern it, is generally assumed
by attraction from a foregoing verb, which however may be under·
stood in its own clause. Thusr, inei noi ἐγὼ λέγω οὐ μόνον δικαιο-
