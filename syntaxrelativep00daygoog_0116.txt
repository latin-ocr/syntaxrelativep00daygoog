occurs, itis not'followedby the relative, asin Latin. mus, Livy
says, cord em et Romanoa et hostes esre qui per tot recula fue·
runt, but we say ‘the same as? When no comparison is implied,
then the construction in Latin and English is the eame3 as, ee
quoque eandem dictatorem qui firden't, Liv. iv. 31, in English,
‘the same dictator who?

tta-'lm interrogative relative ‘how' is generally made in
Latin by the ablatives qao or qai, and according to the rule that
the redditiva member is put in the same case aethe interrogative,
we have the answer in the ablativo, which is in Latin the gerund
in do. The Greek πῶς, on the other hand, is followed in the
redditive member by the nominative of the present participle. ln
like manner, the nominative of the participle has osten in Greek
an instrumental force, in other cases not interrogative.

§oa-'the Greeks are fond of crowding more into a sentence
than its strict syntax will permit. See the use of two subjecta in
relative connexione, where one is put as a direct object to the fore-
going verb, as in the case ‘ye see your calling, brethren, how that
not many wisc men are called ς’ and thus, in the following, we
have an additional verb3 ae, τοσοῦτον μόνου σε ἐγίγνωσκον, ὅσου
tirou o ν Ἀθηναῖον εἶναι, Xen. Anab. iii. l, 45.

§ru-1 have elsewhere noticed, φ 37 (α). Oba, instances of
ὅστις used for ὅς, also aster τίς, and also followed by ὅς of the same
subject3 and in the following it appears to be used of a definite
subject3 aa, τὴν Τισσαφέρνους tutatae ὅστις λέγων, ὡς rar. λ. Xen.
Anah. iii. 2, 4, though the meaning perhaps is, ‘ in that he or any
other person does so? and again, ὅστις, (Edip. Col. 959. Aristoph.
Vesp. 632. 711. And in this passage, ἦ δυσπετῶς ἂν τοὺς ἐμοὺς
ἄθλους φέροις ὅτῳ θουεῖυ μέν ἐστιν οὗ πεπρωμένου, AEschyl. Prom.
777. Blomf, where also, though ὅτῳ has adelinite referenceto ἐμοὺς
or its primitive, the sentiment is generalized, ‘to whom aa in my
case, and wherever the same exemption exists,' &c The following

is peculiare ’ἐστι d' ὅστις καὶ κατελήφθη, Xen. Anab. i. 8, 20, ‘there
wasone individual who was taken by surprise,' as the use of τοῦτον
“ immediately aster seems to compel us to adopt this definite sense.
We have seen the Latin aliquis used in the plural sense of ‘ somc,'
and we may also here imagine that ὅστις is a singular put for
plural, which would doubtless be the fact, were τούτους read in lieu
of τοῦτον.
