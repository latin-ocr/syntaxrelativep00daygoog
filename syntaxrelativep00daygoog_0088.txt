God hath prepared' or ‘eye hath not seen what God bath prepared!
A ⁸, the passage of Homer, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν πολίων ἐξεπράθομεν, τὰ
δι’ amar, ll. α’. 125, where both forms are demonstrative, and where one
is regarded as relative, which it stands for frequently in Homer.

(c) In admirative passages, or mab as cre distinguished by marked
rhetorical emphasis. This is commonly the case with the Greek
οίος and the Latin ουατιίιιε, quam, dac, and is of several kinds.
First, where, as we observed above, a number of relative forms is
merely collected together, expressing different conditione accu-
mulated, all having reference to the same subject; as, quante,
quaties uacationes, qaam preclare sumunt? Cic. pro Milon.
14. 38. Secondly, where the relatives are in agreement with dif-
ferent nouns, but have reference to the same subject, and where
one of them is in reality the demonstrative in a relative dress, thus
changed to convey an admirative sense; as, δείξεις aloc ἐξ
olco ’τράφης Soph. Aj. 550, ‘you will show what sort of person
you bave been reared from such a father as yours was ς’ olo
φίλων ἄκλαυτος οἵοις νόμοις, Soph. Antig. 838, ‘what sort of
person, by laws so nefarious,unwept ογ friends ε’ cla πρὸς οἵω ν
ἀνδρῶν πάσχω, ibid. 929, ‘what sufferings, inflicted ογ a man
such as this, 1 undergo! In each of these cases, however, we may
supply the copula, or omit either of the relatives, without destroy-
ing the construction, though they certainly are not to be wholly
explained in this way. And thirdly, where either the two rela-
tives are governed by different verbs, or one belongs to the object,
and the other to the subject of the verb3 as, ὦ τλῆμον, οἵας οἷος
ὢν ἁμαρτάνεις, Eurip. Alcest. 144, ‘ Ο wretched one, what a mis·
trees, in a condition such as yours, have you lostl' See Monk's
note to this line, and also Pflugk's, with further references, άνω-
λόλυξε τὸν νεανίαν, οῖ’ ἔργα δράσας olo λαγχάνει κακά, Soph‘.
Elect. 737, ‘bewailed the youth for suffering such ills aster doing
such deeds’ 'l'here is here, first, a well-known construction, ογ
which ὁ νεανίας is put as object to ἀνωλόλυξε, instead of as sub-
ject to λαγχάνει; and next, if we were to do away with the admi·
, rative form, we should thus . construet the sentence, ἀνωλόλυξε
ola κακὰ ὁ νεανίας, δράσας τοιάδε, λαγχάνει. 'l'he following exam-
ple in Latin is worthy of notice3 for although it does not contain
the double relative, yet it has assumed the relative in one part of
the sentence, ογ implication from another, where a demonstrative
adjective might have been expected but for the admirative con·
struction, and omits the relative adverb with its proper member.
Thus capitote quantis laboribus fundatum imperium, quauta
uirtute stabilitam libertatem, quarata Deorum benignitate auctas
