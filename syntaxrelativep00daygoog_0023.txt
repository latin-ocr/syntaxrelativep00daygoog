obs. 1. Α3 remarked in the preceding paragraph, it is not always
easy to determine what the ellipsis is; and in other cases the relative
, clause actually 11113 the place 01 the demonstrative, 11 11 does not take its
construction, as in the quotation from Horace, where cai is used in pre.
ference to cujas, in order to mark the construction due to the impersonal
vivitur. In the annexed example the elliptioal word may be made dative
or genitive with rapi: καὶ σφῷνὸ νῦν ἔπαινος, ὃν καμίζετον τοῦδ’ α’νδρὸς,
oie revehor, OEdip. Col. 1406, ‘the praise which you two obtain from
this man, 101 the to 113 which you endure 0111113 account3’ where notice
also the removal 01 the subject out 01 the relative clause, and its being put
as object (here latter 01 1110 substantivas) to the antecedent, in accordance
with the analogy 01 311 extensive class 01 instantes. Several curious
exampies occur in Homer with the relative adjective οἷος, 111 which the
same difficulty occurs3 thus, ὤμ’ α’παταμνόμεναν κρέα ἔδμεναι, old μ’
ἔοργας, Hom. χ’. 347, ‘to eat thy uncooked flesh in revenge for such
evils as thou hast done to me:' ὼκΰμορος δή μοι, τέκος, ἔσσεαι, ol’ όγο-
ρεόεις, ibid, σ’. 95, ‘by reason 01 the things which you state.’ The
other passage quoted by Troilope as belong'ng to the same class, 0101
ἐμόν γε μένος aul χεῖρες ἄαπτοι, ibid. θ’. 450, 13, Ithink, different, and
contains a common construction 01 οἷος, and 113 Latin representative,
qualis, which 13 similarly used, 33 we shall elsewhere see. Itis true,
some would regard them all 33 adverbs here, and translate, ‘so basely
have you treated me ’-‘ so rashly do you talk‘——‘ such is my invincible
prowess 3' but even then it is necessary to account 101 the origin of such
modes of speech, many so-called adverbial forms being only remnants 01
declinable ones, which have in progressos time become fixed and per-
manent.

2. In some examples we may 133011 to different suppositione, while the ’
331113 words admit equally of different constructione. Some impersonale
are followed either by the dative, or the accusative and infinitiva. Thus,
