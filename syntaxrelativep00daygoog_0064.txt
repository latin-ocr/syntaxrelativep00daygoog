noun, stand the corresponding demonstrative, in the same case
and gendes, on which I shall have to say more below.

Obs. The relative is, in fact, used wholly in all the demonstrative con-
structione, sor the conjunction and demonstrative. lt is used in that of
the ablative absolute, in a particular construction, which has been classed
under the head of ‘anacoluthon' in the accusative and infinitive, in the
phrases qua metu, quae audita (Liv. ii. 24), in place os hoc metu, for metu
hujus aud haea audita. There are, besides, many cases in which it is
accompanied by the noun in its own clause in this way3 as, qu em simul
adspexit scabrum intonsumque Philippus, Hor. Epod.i.7: quam

demonstrativipmd cdnjuqnction, or of the relative at the beginning of a
period, called the use of the initial qui, quad, is of perpetual occurrence in
Cornelius Nepos, and is met with frequently in most writers. This is
even carried so far, to bear out the analogy, asto imitate certain construc-
tions in Greek; as, quem perspexisse laborant au si t amicitia dipsas,
Hor. Ars Poet. 435. According to Greek construction, we can here
take the subjectos the aa clause, and make it the object to perspexisse.
But the subjectos the au clause would be is, and not quis, and the quem
is evidently sor et eum. Observe then, that au sit, dcc. is the proper
object of perspexisse, not quem or eum. In the same way, the relative is

construed with a participle ; as, cajus impetratae poeuituit, Liv. ii. 49, and ,

with prepositions, as quatu super, quocum, where the relative usually
precedes, while it follows when a conjunctiou3 ss, postquam, priusquam.

Rsusss. In English we use ‘what,' in like manner, for ‘that which ς’
as, ‘give mc what I spolte of,' and, as iu Latin, this has become the form
os the interrogative3 as, ‘what think youl' Out of the use os the sub-
stantive in the relative clause, governed by a preposition, has arisen in
English the govemment of a relative adverb by the preposition3 as, ‘till
when let us suffer and wait,’ Beaumont aud Fletcher, Maid’s Tragedy,
act ii. sc. l, for ‘till which time!
