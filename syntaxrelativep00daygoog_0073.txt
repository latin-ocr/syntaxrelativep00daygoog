Thus, 10100 quoles ipsi, Cic. de Amisit-22. 82: tates quotis Pyrrhus,
(Incert.) in both 01 which the quotis agrees with the noun in its
own clause, and is of a different number from the demonstrative:
0110 100100 1001100 quanto vos me vestris decretis honestatis,
Cic. in Cat. iv. 10: quanta manns tantem multitudinem, ibide
tanto majore conatu quantoplus erat periculi, Liv.iv. 23,
where observa in the two last, that the relative refers to a different
subject from that to which the demonstrative refers, acircumstance
still more marked in the followingz quod enirn fretam quem Eari-
pumtctmotns, tantas tom 000100101οε putatis opitotiones
fluctuum quantas perturbationes et qnontos oestns
10101 ratio comitiorum, Cic. pro Muren. 17. 35. Again, sed
quantam opere processerant, tanto oberant, Caes. Β. C. i. 73,
where qnantum answers to tanto, the case being modified hythe
verb in each clause respectively, according to the rule of the dis-
tance ‘how far,' and the interval, ‘at which! And lastly, an
adverbial relative answers to an adjectivsl demonstrative3 as,
oirtns 10010 habetur qnantum verbis ec potuere estollerepre-
clara 1090010, sall. Cat. 8. · ,

(’) Qualis and 0000100 are both used interrogatively, and in
expressions of admiration, particularly the latter. They are often
accompanied by their correlatives talis and 100100. The two last
belong to the antecedent substantive, to which they give an
intensive force. The two former then become strictly relative,
and are frequently then used without a subject in their own clause,
though they also commonly enough have one in this case. We
shall put the matter clearly by the following statement: that totis
and tantos are osten lest out before 000110 and 0000100, 10 which
case the antecedent subject commonly falls into the relative mem·
ber, or a fresh one is introduced3 while, on the other hand, aster
talis and tantus, the relative clause is often lest ont, in which case
the two last words obtain a strongly intensive force3 as, in quo ille
tot et tales viros defatigat, Cic. pro Quinct. 13. 42: qni tanti
te tol em ι0000000 parentes, Virg. AEn. i. 606, for qni sont parentes
qni sant 10011 quanti possent pipnere tc talem ¹qualis sin-in tanto
imperio pepuli Romani, Caes. B. G. i. 33.

(1) Tantos and talis are both likewise followed by 01 and by qni,
in place of 9000100 and 900110, and in the order of arrangement and
even of translation, we often put the relative clause before the de-
monstrative. Thus, of the first kind are, nultius dicendi, 001 scri-
bendi 10010 ris, 10010 copiaque 000 dicam esontore possit, ,
Cic. pro Marcell. 2. 5: tonto beneficio auctam 01 10 dom 0 poros
01001001, 850. Liv. i. 39 3 and exemplifying the postponed demonstra.
