tutes an integral part of it, then thc subjunctive is used after it.'
Thus,

sss-Atta an absolute negative proposition, the relative
takes its verb in the subjunctive mood. In this case, the whole
truth of the proposition depends on the limitation which the
relative clause conveys. Thus, cion est nemo in tanto populo, lje.
qni remnllom de meis bonis attigerit-qui defenderit,

Cic. pro domo sua, 41.108: inveniebatur mmo qni se suffragium

de me tulisse confiteretur, Cic. pro Sext. 31. 68: snit non nemo qui

agnosceret Thyora regique nuncimet, Nep. in Dat. 3. When

the proposition is almost an universal negation‚ the subjunctive

follows in like manner, and for the same reason3 as, nmis est solus
inventus qni dissideret, Cic. pro Sext. 62. 130.

Oba. This is also a Greek construction 3 as, obe ἔστιν, dep μείζονα
μοῖραν νείμαιμ’ ἢ σοι’, AEsch. Prom. 291.

ssa-For the same reason, the subjunctive is used in the
relative clause after the indefinite phrases, sunl, reperti sentimenti
went, answering to the English ‘there are,' and some others of the
same class ; as,fitere qni cognoscerent, Sall. Cat. 61, in finem: sunt
qni dicant (possim); reperti sunt complures nostri milites qni insi-
lirent, Caes. B. G. i. 52.

Otr. This rule applies as well to relative particles and adverbs, such as
nbi, unde. In the same way, non est, in the general sense ‘there is not,’
influentes the mood of the verb in the relative clause. The following
observations are copied from the English translation of Zumpt’s Latin
Grammar. “As the use of the subjunctive in these expressions depends
on the relative’s characterizing the class which is indefinitely referred to,
the indicative is used if there be any thing which fixes the verb toa definite
person or persons, Thus, qnidam, denoting, as distinguished from aliquis,
aperson known, but not specified, takes most commonly an indicative.
So sunt nonnulli, snn't multi, are osten used with an indicative, and must be
so, where definite persons are meant. But with sunt qni, the indicative is
titt? tt.¹'t‡ttttltt22²¹l {titt tttt²ly.t.t‘tiftfftt.ttlt
used after sunt multi, though the parties are perhaps not definite3 as,
sunt antem multi, et quidem cupidi splendoris et ploriae qui eri-
piunt, Cic. de Off. i. 14, and also of the subjunctive altar unns, where
the party is indefinite3 as, qnidam eae Gallis unum e Romanis qni
esset optimus provocavit, Eutropii. 6. Valpy, in his edition of Cicero's
Offices, has the following note on the passage, sunt enim qui, non
audent dicere, Cic. Off. i. 24: “ In the present instance, aud in others
similar, where snnt qni is followedby a verb in the indicative, Ernesti has
altered it into the subjunctive. Ι. F. Heusinger asserta that this has been
done against the authority of MSS. ε that where the matter predicated in
the sentence is simple and absolute, without doubt or reserve, the indicative
is properly employed. In the present book, 30, occurs the following
