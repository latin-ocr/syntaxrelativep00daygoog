elsewhere noticed the use os the relative partitively3 thus, ἁπο-
σπάσας γὰρ τῆς ἐμῆς οἴχει φρενὸς αἵ μοι μόναι παρῆσαν ἐλπίδων
ἔτι, Soph. Elect. 796, and the construction τίν’ ἐλπίδων occurs
again below, 941. The very reverse of this takes place in the fol-

lowing: ἦᾶρα δή τις, ὅσαι θεαί εἶσ’ ἐν Ὀλῦμπιρ, Hom. Il. α’.
429, for θεάων ὅσοι, though it may be remarked here generally,
that all these relative adjective forms properly take a substantive
in their clause, which substantive is, however, osten in the predi-
cament of being required in the preceding member, in a different
case. Even the word that, would be properly dependent on a fore·
going adjective, is made to take its place in the relative clause3
οε, ὑγιὴς ἐγένετο ᾦ δήποτε κατείχετο νοσήματι, John v. 4,
which our English translators imitate, ‘was made whole by what-
soever disease possessed 3' sor, ‘was made whole of the discsse,
whatever it might be, by which he was possessed?

Oba. We might apply the law of construction here developed to
the elucidation of passages which are differently understood. Thus,
μὴ τι) μείζων εἷ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν Ἀβραὰμ ὅστις ἀπέθανες καὶ ol
προφῆται ἀπέθανον, John viii. 53, where, hy accentuating ol as the
relative pronoun‚ and regarding προφῆται as transferred for προφῆτων in
the antecedent member, we should have strictly the ordinary construction,
‘than our father Abraham, and the prophets who are dead.’ Be this
as it may, the sense is the same3 for it may be shown by examples
quoted above, that this sudden change from the relative to the direct
structure is common enough in St. J ohn⁹. We might thus explain the
following passage in Pindar: τὶν δὲ κῦδος ἁβρὸν νικάσαις ἀνέθηκε, καὶ ὃν
πατέρ’ Ἄκρων’ ἐκάρυξε καὶ τὰν νέοικον ἕδραν, Pind. Olymp. v. 7, by
supposing that there is a transference of πατέρι into the relative clause,
and a change of case to the accusative, in agreement with ὃν, ‘and having
conquered, obtained, and conferred glory on thee (Camarina), and his
father Acron, and the newly·peopled seulement, whom and which he
caused to be proclaimcd.' This would be objected to, perhaps, by reason
of the article πὰν, which seems to indicate that the structure is direct3
though Ι brought forward instantes in point, where the article with its
noun is so transferred. Itis immaterial, as to the meaning of the passage,
whether this mode of explanation be admitted or not; hut it would remove
a difficulty in accommodating the sense to the construction, which is
perhaps, aster all, one of no importance.

⁹ On further consideration, Ι prefer regarding this instance as of a
common nature with the oues occurring John xv. 6, ‘ If a man abide not
in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered,’ dvc. viz. the branch
is withered‚ &cz also John vi. 39. 44. 54, where the same proposition is
aggindand again enunciated as a leading one, though manifestly only a
su or mate.
