adorned with the choicest flowers of music, in such strains as
we sing,' where Dissen also quotes Pind. Fragm. (103.) and
Donaldsou quotes Pyth. iii. 17.

1 7.-With relative adverbs, in like manner, it is osten necessary
to supply various ellipses mentally3 thus, ὅμως δ’ ‘iv’ ἕσταμεν
χρείας, ἄμεινον ἐκμαθεῖν ri δραστέον, OEdip.Tyr. 1408, ‘in the
position in which we stand, it is better ;’ but Matth. Gr. Gr.
1 180, 3, in explaining this passage, appears to me not quite
conset, who renders by ‘because we are in this state,' regarding
‘tva as put for ὅτι ἐνταῦθα 111111 11 moynie sabito ae conderet,
1111 mundior eniret vin libertinus honeste, Hor. Sat. ii. 7,11.

b 8.—This ellipsis occurs in particular phrases3 as, paucis 111111,
111111 11 centnm erat, Caes. B. G. iii. 23, for poet eoa diaconibus,
and is preserved in postquam, prinsquam, &a the indeclinable or
adverbial forms which have probably arisen out of similar consi-
deratione. To these may be added particular phrases, as diynns
qni, 1111111 qni.

§9.-(a) This ellipsis of the pronoun is very common aster
coynosco, mitto, dica, and some others3 as, quc iynorabant de
L. Domitii faya coynoscnnt, Caes. B. C. i. 20, ‘they learn what
they were previously ignorant ofr' Pausanias dnn Sparta, qnos
Byzantii 1111111, tibi misit, Nep. in Paus. 2, ‘those whom he
had captured :' 111 videbantur dicebat, Nep. in limol. 4.
(1) And likewise after scio, intelliyo, eapedio, ostendo, demomtro,
&a samariamque commisit, qnam milites 1111111111 cnm qni 111
arma conferrent, Nep. in Eum. 31 ostendam beram qnid eit pericli

fallere, Ter. Andr. v. 2, 26, ‘ I'll teach you what risk you run in
deceiving your master.'

Oba. l. The instances‚ however, of this latter kind (1) are hardly to
the point3 for although our English idiom fills up the supposed ellipsis
with the demonstrative, it does not therefore follow that it is proper to do
so in Latin. Indead, in these cases, the antecedent generally finds a place
in the relative clause, or qnia, quid follow, which are strictly equivalent
to such a combination of antecedent and relative, mmking, as they do, a
strictly objective sentence. And the Latius likewise distinguish this

point will be more fully elucidated when we corne to speak of the influence

Liv. iii. 60, ‘from a consciousness of the deficiency of strength,’ where
we do not resort to the supposition of ellipsis
