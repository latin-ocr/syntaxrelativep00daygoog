construction is sileant td, which would be Latin. Again, ὅπως μὴ ἔξαρνος -
ἔστι ἅ νῦν λέγεις, Plat. Euthyd. 283, C. where the ellipsis is perhaps an
ellipsis of the accusative, which is the construction of ἔξαρνος in Plat.
Lysis. 205, Α. καὶ τὸ ἐρᾶν ἔξαρνος sl. .

3. ln other cases, in place of the elliptic genitive and relative, the

Greeks change the construction, as, dv τι πράξῃς καλὸν μετὰ πόνον, ὁ
μὲν πόνος οἴχεται, τὸ δὲ καλὸν μένει· ἄν τι ποιήσῃς αἰσχρὸν μεθ’
ἡδονῆς, τὸ μὲν ἡδὺ οἴχεται, τὸ δὲ αἰσχρὸν μένει· or in such instantes we
may say that both the genitive and the relative clause are elliptical, and
are left to be inserted from the conditional clause, or the latter may be
regarded as their substitute.

4. Besides the examples cited, there are others in which we may pro-
perly have recourse to another method of explanation: thus, νῖψαι
καθαρμῷ τήνδε τὴν στέγην, ὅσα κεύθει, OEdip. Tyr. 1204, is an
instance of the well-known Greek construction, by which the subject of the
relative clause is removed from its own member, and made the object of
the preceding verb, for νῖψαι καθαρμῷ ὅσα ἥδε ἡ στέγη κεῦθει. l say
removed, not so much to indicate my belief that this construction ori·
ginated in this way, but only in deference to a popular method of con-
geiving and stating this. But we may also understand τούτων before
Οσαι

5. There are again many apparent cases of ellipsis occurring before
ὅστις, where either the genitive, dative, or accusative may be supplied.
In some of these ὅστις has a partitive force, and, like the Latin quisque,
is used in the singular with reference to a plural noun. But from a colla-
tion of passages, it appears rather as though the clause with ὅστις is fre-
quently added in some of these cases per epexegesin, or by way of eluci-
dation. Thus we have ἔπειτ’ ἴσως ἂν δεσποτῶν ὠμῶν φρένας τΰχοιμ* ἂν,
ὅστις ἀργύρου μ’ ὠνήσεται, Eurip. Hecub. 356, ‘next perchance it
would be my lot to obtain a cruel-hearted master, whoever should
chance to purchase me.’ If δεσποτῶν is here merely a plural put for
singular, then the construction is regular enough 3 but this will hardly be
allowed, as the use of the plural depends rather on ὅστις. In a somewhat
different way, ἥτις, in the following, may be regarded as a partitive with
πόλεωνε εἴρηται γὰρ ἓν αὑταῖς, τῶν Ἑλληνίδων πόλεων ἥτις μηδαμοῦ
ξυμμαχεῑ, ἐξεῖναι, Thucyd. i. 35 ; or we may regard a dative as elliptical
τινί, though it is certainly not usual to express it in such cases. In fact,
a passage occurring just below, in the same author, seems to prove both
these points, viz. that the τίς is only expressed in the relative clause, but
that the dative is the implied construction: sl γὰρ εἴρηται ἓν ταῖς σπον-
δαῖς, ἐξεῖναι παρ’ ὁποτέρους τὶς τῶν ἀγράφων πόλεων (lotherae ἐλθεῖν,
οὔ τοῖς ἐπὶ βλάβῃ ἑτέρων l ο ὕ σι ν ἦ ξυνθὴκη ἐστίν, ἀλλ’ t οτις,·-·-καὶ
ὅ στι c,-—Thucyd. i. 40. Here ἶοῦσιν is the dative, and as ὅστις has
reference to each one collectively of a class which the Greeks likewise
osten express by a plural, there is nothing here but the ordinary construc-
tion, while the dative implied with ἐξεῖναι has for its substitute τίς in the
next clause. We may thus explain the syntax 'of αλλὰ τιμὴ τοῖσι χρησ-
τοῖς, ὅστις εὖ λογίζεται, Aristoph.Equit.1272.
