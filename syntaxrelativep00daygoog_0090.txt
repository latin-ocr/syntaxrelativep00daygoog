OEdipus, while we are still living,' or, in other words, ‘that Jupiter

sage3 ἆρά μον μέμνησθ’, ὅτι ol' ἔργα δράσας ὑμὶν εἶτα δεῦρ’ ἰὼν
ὁπ οῖ’ ἔπρασσον uillam OEdip. Tyr. 1867. Ι may also notice the
similarity of thia passage with οἷ’ ἔργα δράσας olo λαγχάνει anai,
Elect. 738, quoted above, for ὁποῖος is used elsewhere with οἶος,
where the latter would be expected, though in this particular in-
stance, with the addition ol ὅτι and εἶτα, so disposed, as to give to
the passage the effect os an anacoluthon. And this brings me to
the inferenee, that, alter all, it may he only ὅτι thetis redundant
both here and in the passage from Sophocles, Antigone, 2. In the
first place, aloda and μέμνησθι are so common with ὅτι, that they
may have grown almost, as it were, into one, and Ι have elsewhere
noticed ures of ὅτι with the accusative aud infinitivo, both in Plato
and Xenophon. Its redundancy in other cases has likewise been
referred to. Next, the other passages, quoted by Wunder, are not
strictly analogous, since, in order ‘to connect ὅτι with τελεῖ, we
must suppose that οὐχὶ belongs to ὁποῖον, and not to τελεῖ, while, “
in the passages, OEdip. Col. 1127. Phoeniss. 878, and Demosthenes
de Cor. ιε’, the negative particle belongs to the verb. Itis true,
this might be avoided hy supplying an ellipsis of oilla ἔστι, and
not reading ὁποῖον as au interrogative, hut simply as below in the
fisth line. But if we adopt the supposition, that the construction
is exactly what it would be were ὅτι absent, the meaning ol the
passage would he, ‘knowest thou then any sort of evil that Jupiter
will not bring upon us while we live,' and this exactly corresponds
with what follows, where it is asserted, that ‘there is nothing of
an afflictive kind which has not befallen.' To prevent misappre-
banaian, Ι may notice here, that ὁποῖος is used interrogatively, but

,not directly, as the clause, in which it is found, is dependent on a
