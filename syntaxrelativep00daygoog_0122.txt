translate their works. Ι have elsewhere been led to notice the
great frequency with which the Greeks place, as an accusative to
the governing verh¹, what in Latin is made the subjectos the
governed relative clause, and have shown by numerous examples,
that the relative not only takes the place of the elliptical demon-
strative, as it does in Latin, but undergoes very frequently its
government, so that the ordinary distinction between the syntax of
the demonstrative and relative is here confounded. Here, then,
was a mark of dependency, which the Latins signitied, in a totally
different way, by the use of the subjunctive mood‚ leaving the
relative clause in possession of its subject, and the relative of its
own peculiar construction, but marking clearly the objectiva nature
of the clause. l shall make no apology for introducing the use
of the subjunctive here3 for although its employment aster the
relative is connected by atie of close affinity with many other
cases where the relative does not occur, and may thus seem to
belong more properly to the general doctrine of the subjunctive3
yet it is equally true, on the other hand, that the relative in this
. use may be regarded aa the type or pattem to which the whole
class of these usages hasbeen conformed, and which affords by far
the greatest number of exemplificatione of the practice. In an
earlier part of this work, I have shown how extensively worda
of relative origin serve the pmpose of conjunctione, not only in
the adverbial state, but where the forms are declinable, so that the
relative in the construction of the genitive absolute may even be
made to serve this purpose. It would hence appear, that the aub-
junctive does properly belong to the doctrine of the relative pro-
noun, and though this work has been undertaken with a different
view than that of adding one to the many systema of rules on the
use of the subjunctive, it cannot be here wholly omitted. I shall,
however, confine myself ratberto the illustration of general prin·
ciples, than the mere accumulation of specific rules, which are to
be met with in all the grammatica] writers, and which may be
studied more advantageously in connexion with examples for
practice in composition.
