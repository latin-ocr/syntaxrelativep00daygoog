ol no opposition being implied. It is strictly analogous to the examples
quoted immediately above, from the Prometheus os AEschylua. Homer
makes use of the same thing, χήτεϊ τοιοῦδ’ οἷος· ὁ δ’ ἀλλοδαπῷ ἐνὶ δήμῳ

CHAPTER IV.

THE RELA'PIVE CONS'PRUO'PION AND ‘rna nlnac'r IN ἸἯΕ
ΕΑΜΕ GLAUSE·

§an—m Septuagint Greek version of the Old Testament,
and also that of the New, contain many instances of this class3
which are, however, not wholly confined to these writings. But
as αὐτός is the word which occurs most frequently in these cases,
it has been usual to treat this peculiarity as one which arises out
of the redundant use of οὗτός. 'l'his mode os representation does
not give a sufficient view of the matter 3 the fact being, that either
the construction by οὗτός, or the relative alone, may be made use

of, and, according to the general usage of language, the one should'

be exclusive of the other, while here, on the contrary, both are, as
it were, jumbled into one. 'lhis is not confined to αὐτός, as we
shall presently see3 while, again, there are many other modes of
expression, in which this pronoun appears superfluous, or rather
seems, as it were, put to indicate the government os the verb that
accompanies it, which has been separated from its own natural
connexion, by some independent construction, as the genitive abso-
luta or so forth, where no relative construction has been employed.
'l'he repetition of the antecedent substantive, in the relative clause,
has already been abundantly illustrated, but this is quite a differ·
ent thing from the repetition of the demonstrative pronoun 3 be-
cause, although the latter is but a pronominal representative of
the antecedent substantive, and therefore may be thought merely
to occupy its place, it really contains, in itsels, much more3 viz,
a peculiar law ol construction as well as a correspondent sense.
The writer of the Apoealypse indulges this practice more, perhaps,
than any other. Thus δέδωκα ἐνώπιόν σου θύραν ἀνεῳγμένην ἣν
οὐδεὶς δύναται κλεῖσαι αὐτήν, Rev. iil. 8. Some editions read
καὶ for ἣν, but if this reading hasbeen adopted merely to obviate
the difficulty in construction, it is of little use, as the examples of
