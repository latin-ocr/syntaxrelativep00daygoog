σῦνην, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἄλλος εἶναι ἆρετᾶς. ΣΩ. τί νας τα vivom Plat.
Men.74,A: ἆληθῆ ’ἔμοιγε δοκεῖν, καὶ καλόν. ΜΕΝ.τίνα τοῦ·
το ν; καὶ τ i v ες oi λέγοντες; ibid. 81, A, where the principle of
construction explains itself 3 the first τίνα, relating to a foregoing
word, takes the case of that word, while τίνες, resening to an
unnamed subject, is put in the nominative. So again, μαντεύμασιν.
OE. ποίοισι το ὕτοις; Soph. OEdip. Col. 383. This attraction
is sometimes reversed, and instead os the relative agreciug with
the proper subject, and assuming its case, it attaches itself to the
predicate. ThUS, notan δύναμιν ὧδ’ ἔχει διπλῆν, Soph.
OEdip. Tyr. 909, where ποίαν should be the subject of ἔχει, ‘what
has this double power?

(Ιι) Apposition clame in tlte ease os tlte Relative instead os tlte
case of tte Snbject: Attvoctv'on. Thus, καὶ αὕτη ἐστὶν ἡ ἐπαγγελία,
ἣν αὐτὸς ἐπηγγείλατο ἡμῖν, τὴν ζωὴν τὴν αἰώνιον, ΙΕρ.
John ii. 25. ro which we may add, Hom. ll. γ’. 122. See p. 43,
§25 (d), though the example there is not so marked as in this
instance, in consequence os the antecedent being in an oblique
ease, which is here the principal subjectos the proposition. ln
these two examples it is not the vennativvs prepositiones, as the
attracted words here follow instead of preceding the relative
clause.

§tid-There is another class of examples belonging to this
division of our subject, in which it is not the antecedent substau-
tive, but only a qualifying adjective, which has reference to that
antecedent, that is placed in the case and clause of the relative.
Thus, ἦν di coitura τῶν σταθμῶν, οὓς πάνυ μακροὺς ἤλαυνεν,
Xen. Anab. i. 5, 7, where there is an ellipsis of ἔνιοι, while a
curious transferenoe of advo μακροί from the antecedent clause
into that of the relative, with which μακροί is then made to agree,
takes place. Again, servas qnevn unicam sanaverat, Delect:
qvem natan fidelissimum, Nep. Thena. 4: qvem tvm Epami·
noradus plurimam ditipebat, Epam. 4, where l would object to
the adverbia] mark over plurimam. Again, qvem carissimam
tabennensium: qvam prenae aqna lem habebat, ibid. 17: pulsi
repnis qnae manime, Virg. AEn. vii. 2172 jamque ascendebant
collem qni plurimas nrbv' imminet, Virg. AEn. i. 419: qaae μοί,
cherrima, ibid. v. 728 ³. But, in point offset, in most of these

³ These are different, though not so much so as would at first sight appear,
from cases like the following: qvos invocatos vidisset, Nep. Cim. 4, where
invocatos isan infinitiva verb, or rather the two words invocatos vidisset
go to make up one notion3 but when the qualifying word is an infinitivo
or participle, we do not see any singularity.
