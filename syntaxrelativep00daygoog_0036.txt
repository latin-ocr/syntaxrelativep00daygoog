enoc to the various readings, before noticing Wundcr's note in his ’

edition, ‘ perrntmm est recentissimos editores revocare potrdsse
οἰὶἱοιὶικίνιιινι scripturam ιι consuetudine loquendi Graecorum aliems·
rinenm ᾧμὴ, κ.τ.λ. pamm rectissime jam Erfurdtiar olim, qnod solam
scribi ιι poetopotait, δν μὴ restituisset! Again, ἐξ ὧν ζῇς καὶ ποιεῖς
καὶ τολιτεΰει, Demosth. dc Cor. νηί but this is hardly, perhaps,
to the point; for the relative having taken the place and construc-
tion of the demonstrative, although the two last verbs take the
construction ἐκ τούτων, the dwill stand indifferently for any case,
and thus many instances will be found, in which two verbs, taking
adifferent case, are coupled with one relative, which has assumed
the case of the demonstrative, hythe ordinary Greek attraction or
substitution, and which does not, in reality, stand for two cases
itself. 'l'hc same may be said of this instance, εἴτι τῶν ἄλλων, ὧν
νυνὶ διέβαλλε καὶ διεξήει,1)ειιιοεῐ1ι. de Cor. ς’, the ὧν being a case
of attraction with ἄλλων; sor, although the verb of accusing takes
a genitive in Latin, διαβάλλοι is construed withan accusative, see
d, and preposition, or genitive os the person3 and διεξῄει likewise
takes an accusative, see η’. So too διεξέρχομαι, ις’. Some of the
cases may be classed under this section, orb 19. (b); as, ἐκ τῶν
φοινίκων, οἳ ἦσαν ἐκπεπτωκότες τοὺς δὲ καὶ ἐξέκοπτον, Xen.
Anah. ii. 3, 10, where supply ὧν, ‘some of which they cut down,’
or regard the last member as direct. Again, in consequence of a
zertpmn, we require to understand another case of the relative in
relative sentences, as in the following, dii cujas jurare timeret et
fallere namen, Virg. AEn. vi. 324, where supply mentally, per
quod with jurare. This, however, is not peculiar to the relative3
and we may understand, per cujus namen, thus preserving the case
of the relative. The following affords an example unless other-
wise explained3 οὓς ἡ μὲν πόλις ιἰπήλιισε, σοὶ δ’ ἧσο ν φίλοι,
Dem. de Cor. κε’, but the change here is probably not without rhe-
torical point and emphasis, and is introduced with this express view,
‘whom the state banished, but they were your particular friends?
The last instances which here follow are however free from
objectiont ὃν μήτ’ ὀκνεῖτε, μήτ’ ἀφῆτ’ ἐ’πος κακόν, OEdip. Colon.
728, ‘whom neither fear nor on whom? Even here, however,
the relative has reference only to the possessive pronoun ἐμῆς, and
had the construction been made by ἀλλὰ μὴ ὀκνεῖτε ἐμέ, our case
would only have exhibited a zeugma of two verbs governing dif-
ferent cases of the personal pronoun. Again, ο ὗς κεν ἐῢ γνοίην καί
τοῦνομα μυθησαίμην, Ηοιιι. 1142235, where understand dv: acm
qui cum inpectis conflictatur ejusmodi neqece commovetur animas,

ff Ter. And. i. 1, 66, where supply cujus: cai comminus ensem
