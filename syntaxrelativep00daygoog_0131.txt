§vu—The objectiva clause in Greek does not take its verb in
the subjunctive, at least not for the same reason as the Latin, even
when the antecedent is in the relative chose, nor atter τίς. Τιιε
use of ὅτι, hkewise, after verbs of knowledge, &c as εἰδέω, γιγνώσκω,
with the indicative, is familiar to every body. Thus, rt δ’, εἰ βου-
ληθεῖμεν titt ναι μὴ μόνον ποῖοι ἄνθρωποί εἶσιν ἢ ποῖοι
ἵπποι, ἀλλὰ καὶ τίνες αὐτῶν, κ. r. λ. Plat. Alcib. i. lll, E: ὁρᾷ c
ὅπως ῥᾳδίως ἅμα καὶ ποιητικῶς ἐξειργασάμεθα, Lucian,
Char. et Mero.

(a) The cases in which the optative is used after ὡς, ὅτι, belong
to the same class as those in which the subjunctive is used in
Latin, in the oblique oration, and thus we may account for the use
of ὅτι and the optative, particularly atter verba of ‘ telling,' because
iu these instances the statement is that of some other person than
the narrator. This practice is exemplified in the followingr εἰρω-
τέοντος δὲ τοῦ Δαρείου baro d απὴ εἴη . . . ὁ θ’ ἀμείβετο, τίνες δὲ ol
Παίονες ἄνθρωποί εἰσι, καὶ τί κεῖναι ἐθέλοντες ’ih θοιε ν ἐς Σάρδις
...ἔφραζον ὡς ilduara-..ela δὲ ἡ Παιονίη ...εἴησαν δὲ
...ὅδέείρώτα εἰ καὶ πᾶσαι εἴησαν, raah. Herod. Terpsich. 132
μνήμην παλαιῶν πεμμάτων ἔχοιμ’, ὑφ’ ὧν θάνοι μὲν αιἰτάς, τὴν δὲ
τίκτουσαν λίποι, Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 1222. Notioe, however, the
mixture of construction at εισι in the first passage, where either
the change is from indirect ιο direct, and the Greeks allow them·
salves many liberties of this sort, or the indicative is purposely
put, to distinguish the positive information here required, from the
mere reason they might assign why they came, at ἔλθοιεν. Βοι
the Greeks do not adopt this practice in the oratio recta, as the
Latius do, and from the great frequency with which we find the
direct object in Greek, where the Latius usually make this object the
subjectos a whole objectiva clause, there is reason ιο believe that
they did not, ιο the same extent, regard the relative clause as
objectiva, but rather as exegetical or explanatory. At all events,
the difference between Greek and Latin practice in arrangements
of this kind, seems to have some connexion with the difference of

the syntax employed. The use of the subjunctive in the oblique
oration aster the relative, when the clause is explanatory, is to be

accounted· for by another rule.
(b) The use, however, οι the optative and conjunctive, in the

oblique oration in Greek, is ve1y much modified by the great
freedom with which th'e writers in this language pass from the
