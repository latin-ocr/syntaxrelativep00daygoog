² nr the relative is in an objective case, do not usually repeat the object
,ιι in English, but the verbs in such clauses all seem to be referred to
lirst relative as a common object. Hence the apparent redundancy in
following: τὰ γὰρ ἔργα d ἔδωκε’ μοι ὁ πατὴρ ἵνα τελειώσω ούπύ, John
536. Regarded in another point of view, however, an instance like this
similar to others we have brought forward above. To the same purpose
ιι certain passages in which the English translators have imitated this
¹nctly. Thus, ‘whom when they had washed, they laid her in an
,ρον chamber,’ Acts ix. 37, where we should do better to read, ‘whom,
’.ιιι they had washed her, they laid.’ The obvious confusion which isthus
ιιοιΙιιοοά, αι to which verb the relative is really governed by, explains
.tliciently why the two verbs should be referred to one and the same
pact, without the introduction of a second. So again, ‘whom when
mila and Priscilla had heard, they took him,’ Acts xviii. 26: ‘whose
aes of his feet,’ ibid. xiii. 25, for ‘the shoes of whose feet :' ‘what
od hath cleansed, that call not thou common or unclean‚’ ibid. x. 15,
here ‘what’ should by itself be equivalent to ‘that which,’ and is almost
nways so used. The practice of supplying each clause with its own
..bject is not even confined to αὑτός, for we have, though rarely, examples
nke the following: καὶ οὓς ἂν λάβωσι τῶν Ἑλλήνων δεινὰ ὑβρίζειν λέγονται
πούς Ἕλληνος, Xen. Anah. vi.4,a.

§22.-Agreeably to what has been shown above, we may, I
think, defend the integrity of such passages as the following, in

which the personal pronoun is placed in close contiguity with the
relative in the same member. They are, ὃν, καὶ πρὶν ἐς φῶς μητρὸς
ἐκ γονῆς μολεῖν ἄγονον Ἀπόλλων Λαΐιρ μ’ ἐθέσπισεν, Eurip. Phoen.
1597: ἣν χρῆν α’ ἐλαύνειν τήνδ’ ὑπὲρ Νείλου ῥοὰς, ibid. Androm.
641: real παῖς ἄτεκνος, ἣν ὅδ’ ili ἡμῶν γεγὼς ἐλᾷ δι’ οἴκων π ἡ ν d'
ἐπιπάσας κόμης, ibid. 700: οἷ μὲν τοσοῦτοι παῖδες οὐκέτ’ εἶσί μοι,
Eurip. Hec. 804, which the editors seem to think corrupt, butI
own I do not. Again, we have αἵτ’ ἐπεὶ obv χειμῶνα φύγον καὶ
ἆθέσφατον ὄμβρον κλαγγῇ ταίγε πέτονται ἐπ’ Ὠκεανοῖο ῥοάων,
Hom. ll. γ’. 4. And thus, exemplifying the force of parenthesis
in Latin 3 tantos epo solus faciam, qui pactum unicum, pu e m pariter
ati Itis domitant etiam amplias, qaod illa οἱον magis od ftaec utenda
idonea est, eum eqo hinc ejeci miserum injustitia mea, Ter. Heaut.
i. sc. 1. 79. See also example, b 25, (b) quoted from Liv. iv. 15.
And, again, ὃ καὶ ἐσπούδασα αὐτὸ τούτο ποιῆσαι, St. Paul, Galat.
ii. 103 so Galat. iii. 2. Romans ix. 24. which two last are quoted

below.

Oba. The example, Hom. Il. y'. 4, may be explained in asimilar way to
others, by supposing that the Greeks often deemed it right to expressa
subject to each clause, as well as an object3 since the clause beginning vvith
ἐπεὶ is not isolated here from αἵτε, for the relative is here meant to be the
nominative to φύγον, as can be shown by analogy with other examples.
But agreat number and variety of confusions of this sort might be adduced,

' ' from which it appears, that after parenthesis, or when a verb is separated
