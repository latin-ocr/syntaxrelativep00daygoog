bb] nnnrrmonr. Accusnvrvn. 9

οὓς εἶπον, Xenoph. Anah. i. 2, ‘Cyrus having those whom
Imentioned:' δουλωσάμενοι μὲν ᾦ κακία ψυχῆς ἐνεγίγνετο, ἐλευθε·
ρώσαντες δὲ ᾧ riperti, Plat. Phaedr. 256, Β, ‘that part of the
soul in which the baser qualities were, and that in which virtue
was situated ι’ ἀλλ’ ἀναγκάσαι θεοὺς ἂν μὴ θέλωσιν, Soph. OEdip.
Tyr. 275, ‘faraman to compel the gods to do the things
which they are determiued not to do is impracticablez' καὶ ἐποίησε
σοφὸν ὅσα διδασκάλων ἀγαθῶν ε’ίχετο,,ΡΙειί. Men. 93, D, ‘and
had him well instructed, so far as instruction was to be had
from good tcacherst' οὐκοῦν καὶ οὗτος τὸν υἱὸν τὸν αὑτοῦ Λυσί-
μαχον, ὅσα μὲν διδασκάλων εἴχετο, κάλλιστα Ἀθηναίων ἐπαίδευσεν,
ibid. 94, A. In both these examples, we may understand an accu-
sative after averli ofteaching. Again, καὶ ἃ μὲν ἂν ἐπινοήσαντες
μὴ ἐπεξέλθωσιν, οἰκείων στέρεσθαι ἡγοῦνται, Thucyd. i. 70, ‘they
deem themselves deprived of their own property, where they do
not succeed in realizing those things which they have once
designed to obtain?

Obs. l. In this last and similar examples, the elliptical word appears
to be the Greek accusative absolute, ‘as to those things.’ But different
persons will regard the construction differently. Some would call it
anacoluthon, some ellipsiS, and others again neither of these. We may
rather say, perhaps, that the whole relative clause occupies the place of
the accusatione praepositivas so common in Greek.

2. Many other cases of this ellipsis might be quoted, as the following :—
προαγορενόντων ἡμῶν ἅ ἐμέλλομεν ὑπὸ Ἀθηναίων βλάπτεσθαι, Thucyd.
i. 68: but here an attraction of the relative into the case of the antecedent
takes place, which examples Ι have reserved for another place. Again‚
in the use of εί τις in Greek, and si qais in Latin, au accusative is osten
wanting, which may be conceived of as transferred into the relative clause,
and this usage belongs to adifferent class. Thus, καὶ, μάντις εί r ι ς εἴη
παραγγείλας παρεῖναι, Xenoph.Anab.vi.4,15, ‘bidding each who was
a priest to be present :¹ lex erat Thebis pace morte multabat, si qais
imperium diutius retinuisset, Nep. in Epam. 7. It is not, however, merely
an accusative that is wanting, but the relative clause stands in other con-
nexions. Thus si mala condiderit ia quem qa is carmina, jas est jadi-
clamque, Hor. Sat. ii. 1, 82, where we may substitute ia eam qai for si
qais. This suppressed sense is not uncommon before the conditional
clause introduced by ri in other cases; as, bacchatur vates mapsam si
pectore possit eacassisse Deum, Virg. AEn. vi. 78, ‘with a view to do s0.’

3. In the subjoined example, vetabo qai Cereris sacram vulparit arcaaae,
sub isdem sit trabibus, frapiletaae mecam so lo at phaselum, Hor. Od. iii.
2, 26, the construction may be vetabo eam ut solvat, or vetabo at is solvat,
the at in this construction being also frequently omitted. See my Aecus.
and Infin. ξ 4. art. 3.

Elliptical Ablatioe.

‚b fn-In the instances I am now going to 'quote, an* ablative is
wanting, or what is the same thing, the whole relative clause
