qai dicunt would mean, ‘they are the persons who are known to
say ς’ sont poi dhoet, ‘there are persons (of that class) who say ς’
via invenitur qai deddwot, ‘that particular person who is known
to desire is scarcely to be found ς’ vic incenderent decideret,
‘hardly a person isfound to desire’ In the next example, qui
being only explanatory of the subject, the indicative follows z fortes
ipitor et mopnoeimi root habendi noo qai socium aed qui propulsant
injuriam, Cic. de off. i. 19. ln this example, equally with the
former, poi designatas a class, not any definitely-known individual,
but here the verb habendi has a predicate, fortes et magnanimi, and
the relative clause belongs to the subject 3 on the contrary, suat
and invenitor must be regarded as impersonal usages, and the
relative clauses as predicates, not as forming any portion of the
subject, any more than in the more strictly impersonal uses of the
participle in doe, so clearly marked by the neuter termination
in m.

(e) The rule with reference to the subjunctive in objective
clauses is sometimes violated in dialogue or a personal address,
where, in fact, the clause in question ia direct, though seemingly
dependent on another verb, which is in reality put in paren-
thetically. But generally these are not relative clauses. Ihave
elsewhere shown, see my Accusative and Infinitive, page 34, o 3,

time, opinor. The various combinatione of cerdo qais, nereio
quod, nescio quomodo, ⁸5⁶· are used also parenthetically, and the
verb following is in the indicative. Even in other arrangements,
nescio itself stands in the indicative, where other words are put in
the subjunctive 3 as, me misaam poe eoae mario, Ter. Hec. ii. l, 8.
Vide t 83. Certein adverbial combinatione, as quidvis, quidlibet,
for quidoelie, quidlibeot, may also be added. Nescio, however,
when followed by oo, takes the subjunctive.

rule, quod is used adjectively, and qaid substantively, a genitive is fre-

the indicative, however, in examples of this sort, marks a distinction
between qood -and quid thus used substantively, qaid being the proper
