acres, but rather the great moderatiori he had displayed in accept-
ing so few, indicated his equity. Again, si dolor precordiornrn
est aut totius pectoris ant qai in plurimis evenit capitis, Cels,
where qai agrees with debr.

(c) Neuter ponder ratker than any particular subject cf apreement.
This practice, which is not peculiar to the relative, is very pre-
valentin Greek. Thus, ὅπερ σαφεστάτη πίστις, Thucyd. i. 35. So
in Latin, qao pacto lroc celem qnod rae orarit Myrrhina sua
pnatoe parturn, Ter. Hecyr. iii. 4, 32: e mmma latitia atque
Ιοοοὶυἱο que (quas) diuturno quiec pepererat, Sall. Cat. 31. These
are scarcely cases, however, of false concord.

(d) Apreernent arith tlre person in lieu os tae tlrinp. Thus, daos
pretores Sicilia atquc Sardinia occupatos, quoram neutro lroc
ternpore prouincia pra t o r'e cpeat, Liv. xxii. 25, where it should
more correctly have been quarum provinciaram, since the quoram
referring already to the praetors, the construction should have
been either as stated, or quibus with pretore omitted.

q san-ln Latin, where earn followed by its predicate, or where
a verb of naming with its object, occurs in the relative clause, the
relative very commonly agrees with the word that follows the verb
in both these instances, instead of with the proper subject or
antecedent. This practice is very common in Greek3 as, ἡ τοῦ
ῥεύματος ἐκείνου πηγή, ὃν ἵμερον stc Γανυμήδους ἐρῶν
ὠνόμασε, Plat. Phradates, O,where see Stallbaum's note to his
edition, and reference to Kriiger de Attractione Linguae Lat.
p. 122, sqq. q 53. A very peculiar instance of this sort is this:
ὁ γὰρ νοὸς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἅγιός ἐστιν, οἵτινές ἐστε ὑμεῖς, 1 Cor.
iii. 17. And in the same way, if the subject and predicate of the
verb εἰμί precede the relative clause, the relative will agree osten
with the latter3 ae, ὡς οὐδέποτ’ ἂν εἴη ῥητορικὴ ἄδικον
πρᾶγμα, t' ‘y’ ἀεὶ περὶ δικοιοσΰυυς τοὺς λόγους ποιεῖται, Plat.
Gorg. 460, E: ἄλλ’ ἐγὼ πειράσομαι φράσαι ὅ γέ μοι φαίνεται εἶναι
ἡ ῥητορική εἶ δὲ μὴ τυγχάνει ὃν τοῦτο, ibid. 463, E, where
see Stallbaum’s notes. The relative here influcnces also the agree-
ment of the participle ὃν, which should have been οὖσα. ln the
subjoined example, alter averb of naming, ὠνομάσθης ὃς εἶ, Soph.
OEdip. Tyr. 1007, ὃς is conformed to the subject of εἰμί, as it
should be, but the name is suddenly exchanged for the person it
represents, andin consequence of this change εἰμί put for ’ἔχω 3 and
thus it appears as though the relative had assumed the wrong
gender. But other expressions seem to explain this difficulty, as

δηλοῦτον ἡμῖν ὄνθ’ ὃς εἶ, Soph. OEdip. Calon. 555, where Wun-

der does not explain this correctly by ostendant nobis esse te eum -
