sucin, for quibus, Ter. And. iii. 2, 8. There are otber instances in which
the adverb stands, where the construction requires the pronoun, but where
the reference is to some other implied subject significant of place3 as,
Θρῄκιος ἱππότης, ἵν’ ὁ γέρων πατὴρ ἔθετό νιν, Eurlp. Hecub. 697. The
construction properly requires ql, but it is confonned to θρῄκη, implied in
the adjective, and not to ἱππότης. Ιιι the following passage, ἥδε δυωδεκάτη,
ll r’ tc Ἴλιον εἰλήλουθα, ll. φ’. 81, we may put ἀφ’ ἦς ln lleu of dre. While
speaking of dre, though it is hardly relevant here, lmay notice that Homer
uses it in contrast with ἄλλοτε, ll. ν’. 49, in the sense of ‘at one time,' but
aecented ὁτέ in this case.

6. The adverbs are very frequently interchanged witb one another3
thus, eum is put for quod, Ter. Andr. iii. 2, 8. Quid is put for cur, ibid.
iii. 2, 49. Ubi is put for ut; aa, siue adeo digna res est ubi tu aanor
intendas tuos, Ter. Eun. ii. 3, 20. Ae, atque, probably relative forms,
are used after tam, clius, and equivalent adjectives, or aller comparatives,
in the same way as quau, or where de quo, or some other arrangement,
might be put in their place. Thus, qui sanior ac si, Hor. Sat. ii. 3, 241 :
nihilo plur ac ri, ibid. 270. Comparing ut with other adverbial uses, we
find it used for quam admirative, quam intensive, quantum, quum, quamvis,
quomode, and, like qui, joined with pote aud cunque.

7. There are a great many adverbs commencing with an initial u,
as uuquam, unde, ubi, uter, ut, uti, of whose general origin there cannot be
much doubt. The u in Greek, in the initial position, is always accom-
panied with the rough breathing, and if we suppose that the q of the
Latius answered to this, occurring as it does before u, aud corresponding
too with the English w in ‘who,’ ‘whose,' their relation to the qui form is
at once seen. Unde appears to correspond with the Latin de quo, being
used of place, person, cause, and also interrogatively like qui,· aa, u n d e
maqurn juventur metu deqrhum coutinuqt, Hlor. Od. i. 33 llgmlqt iilikelhise
use ιιι constructron ιιι a noun ο ‘ ace3' as, u e rr . n.
viii. 114, though ulti, like the Greek seul) has come to signify substaittively
‘the where,’ and is thus construed with the genitive, in the well-known
exqresqqoq,quqhqqrqqyoq bf the tendency of declinable forms to become
adverbial³, we may instance the use of cunque, whose orthography
bespeaks its relative origin. lt is used by Horace in the expression,
milti cunque rite vocanti, for quandocunque. If we look to the forms quis-
quis, quamquam, quaqua, and compare thern with quicumque, quamcunque,
and quacunque, no doubt can exist as to their intimate relation, and this is
set beyond all question, when we meet with quantus quantus for quantus-
cunque, Ter. Adelph. iii. 3, 40. Phorm. iv. 7, 103 and so ubi ubi for ubi-
llllfhindthllhlflli ltrttlllttttrnltfp‘ltt 3333? 33
interrogatively‚ require a definite answer, that the duplication of thern
rendere thern indefinite, for which ageneral adverbial form, cunque, was
invented, applicable to all cases⁴. Itis possible also, that in other cases
the declinable ending is lost sight of, through the change of a vowel, or

³ Thus some words that have become indeclinable still retain their force
as adjectives3 as, abs quiuis homine, Ter. Adelph. ii. 3, 1.

⁴ We may see this effect iu other penicles3 thus, jam jamque manu
tenet, Virg. AEn. ii. 530.
