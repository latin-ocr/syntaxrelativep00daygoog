§39.] cur uv rua nnuousranrrvn cousraucrrorv. 81

Nep. Them. 2: qno voce ondita occasionem oblatam, tyr. Liv.
iv. 26: et, quo qvid ulterius privato timendum foret, in vincula
etiarn duci possent, ibid. iv. 26, where it is common to put the ·
parenthesis. Sometimes the et accompanies the quo, though the
relative has itself the force of the conjunction3 as, pus quoque qua
cumque parte erumpit, si est teve, album etunius coloris, sine utto
metu est,· et qno effluo febris protenus conquievit, Cels. ii. 8.
Here either et is superfluous, or it connects the clause thus, si est
teve (et quo effuso febris conquievit, in lieu of quale, tyc.) sine utto
metu est; but this postponement is very unusual, and 1 prefer the
first suppositiou.

(d) In imitation of certain demonstrative constructione. Thus
we have boc metu in the sense of ‘from sear of this,' which is
imitated in the expression quo metu, signifying, ‘from sear of
which! 1 have quoted above, atque boc metu tatius vapori pro-
bibebvt, Caes. B. G. v. 19: boc ira consules in Volscum aprum
lepiones durem, Liv. ii. 22, and as corresponding with them, quo
metu Italia omnis contremuerat, Sall. B. J. 1442 qno con-
spectu, EutropvittO: quo terrore,Liv.i.58: tvmvlvs quo
summo, Virg. AEn. iii. 22: quo tumultu, Sall. Cat. 43: troc
dolore, Caes. B. G. v. 4.

(e) Wbere the relative bas on effective or possessive pronoun in
connexion mitt it. As, quos sivaa theja ventosa per equora
vectos obruit Auster, Virg. AEn. vi. 335: qnod quidem meum
consitium minime obscurum sivit, Cic. pro Marcell. 5. 15.

(s) When tte sunau tas been taken ont os its oron clause, ond put
as object to tbe preceding] verb, on ubist snat clause as v sobole is
dependent. The following not very common instance occurs in
Latine quem perspevisse laborent an sit amicitia dipnus, Hor.
Ars Poet. 435. This is analogous to ἃ πάντες ἴστε ὅτι συμφέρει,
Demosth. Olynth. Β. s‘.: ὃν ὑμεῖς λέγετε, ὅτι Θεὸς ὑμῶν ἐστι,
st. John viii. 54. ix. 19. x. 36, where ἐκεῖνος is removed from the
relative clause, changed into ὅς, and made the direct object to ἡ
λέγετε, and the same takes place in the Latin passage just quoted.

(p) thb tte subjunctive in an optative serese. ln English we
do not use the relative in this way3 we say, ‘may it be,’ not
‘may which be.’ And in Latin, the relative pronoun is in what
'l have termed its demonstrative construction ; as, qvod bene
verta t, Liv. i. 28, ‘which may it turn out well ε’ quod bonum
faustum felin sit, ibid, a well-known formula. So in Greek, ὃ
μὴ τύχοι ποτέ, Eurip. Phoen. 571.

(b) th another relative in its own member. These cases I have
noticed in the previous chapter, merely to show that they do not
so much belong there as here. Ι there brought forward in illus-

a

ε’
