Here, if we supply est, the meaning is, that those who hold the chief
place, arrd those who have the most comrades, display great emulation;
whereas the meaning most probably is, that the emulation is called into
exercise, in order 10 obtain these relative degrees of emineuce.

(b) That the infinitive mood, as it is called, always an objective one,
except when used as an abstract verbal noun, is of the same origin as the
subjunctive, little doubt can exist, when the strict correspondence of its
two principal forms with those of the subjunctive is considered. The t of
the 3rd person imperfect and pluperfect being dropped, is the only mark
of difference, and the person does not require to be distinguished, as it is
either expressed before it in the objective case, or assumed from that of
the governing verb. Thus there were two or more methods ofexpressing
an objective clause; one by using 1 personal clause, with a nominative
subject usually introduced by a relative, or by a conjunction of the relative
class, the other hyan accusative and the impersonal form of the sub·
junctive (or the infinitive in other words). Thus, when two verbs are
used to express one general notion, i. e. where the first expresses a modal
¹ condition, and the last the 101100, 10 objective form is used, as, 0011111011
facere.

b 80.-It is always necessary in using qni with its verb, 10 dis-
criminate whether the relative clause merely states 11101, or con-
tains an explanation given hythe writer3 or whether it expresses
an allegation of some other party3 in other words, whether orno
the writer is suggesting a fact or reason of his own, or of some one
else. Thus, id esse consiliunt Caesaris ut quos iu conspectu aaut·

011. 1. Α1 Ι have before stated, the same case may belong to two or
three special rules. ln the first example, vereretur is in the subjunctive,
because it contains the allegation, not of the writer, but of other parties3
and if it did not, it might still be the subjunctive, became it may constitute
an integral portion of the object of a preceding verb in the subjunctive.
