1 have not, however, the slightest doubt, that the distinction between
the relative and demonstrative did not at first exist. Ido not mean to
say that Homer made no distinction, as this would be altogether inaccurate.
The Latina used the initial relative aster a full point, without limitation‚
in lieu of the demonstrative and copula. This does not appear to be the
case in Homer, so far as I have noticed; for in these cases he uses the τος
form for oblique cases, reserving the ὅς form for the more strictly relative
clause, occurring in the middle of a period3 though he likewise uses τά
freely in this last situation, accompanied commonly by μέν and δέ, which
seems to connect the τα’ in its origin with the demonstrative. He does
not, any more than Pindar, nse the τος form for the nominative singular,
and the nominative plural is in general οἵ, though Pindar, as we have seen,
makes use of τοί, ταί frequently enough in the plural. On the other hand,
the particle ῥά is very usual with τόν, as with ὅν the relative, in the
beginning of a period, where the Latios ure the relative form. The inter-
change of the article and relative, or rather the use of the same form for
both, is exhibited familiarly enough in the German language, while relative
adverbs are used by many writers, where· in English we require the
demonstrative forms, and vice oersd, the demonstrative forms are osten to
be translated by relative ones in our language. Thus, cladomb, ‘ whereby,’
ωοοοο, ‘thereofi’ Kant's Criticism of Pure Reason‚ p. 218. The suppo-
sition, that only one form originally existed both for article and pronoun,
is confirmed by the practice of the Hebrew tongue, in which the use of
the relative is unknown, and whose relative clauses are expressed by
means of distinct parenthetic propositions. In Homer, as we have seen,
there is some difficulty in distinguishing the two classes of words3 for
although separate forms had in his time got into use, yet the necessities of
the metre may sometimes account for the use of one in preference to the
other. Even in much later periods, the so-called article had not lost its
force as a relative, as may be seen from many passages in the Attic poets.
Thus, γύναι, νοεῖς ἐκεῖνον, ὅντιν’ ἀρτίως μολεῖν ἔφιέμεσθα, τόν θ’ οὗτος
λέγει, OEdip. Tyr. 1025, ‘and whom this man speaks of :’ μὴ καὶ μάθη,
μ’ ἥκοντα, κᾶκχέω τὸ πᾶν σόφισμα, τῷ νιν αὐτίχ’ αἱρήσειν δοκῶ, Soph.
Philoct. 13, ‘the whole cunning device, by which lexpect very shortly
to get possession of him.’

Having alluded to the use of ὃς μέν, ὃς δέ, for ὁμέν, ὁ δέ, Ι shall be
excused lor noticing another class of cases, in which ὁ δέ is used, not by
way of apposition or contrast, but where its place might be supplied by
the relative pronoun; οε, τίς σὺ ξυνασχαλᾷ κακοῖς τεοῖσι, δίχα γε Arde-3
ὁ δ’ ἐπικότως ἀεὶ (sc. Ζεύς), AEsch. Prom. 167: φοβοῦμαι, τὸν μυριωπὸν
εἰσορῶσα βούταν, ὁ δέ πορεύεται, ibid. 584. See also the same play,
vV. 679, 881⁴. Many other examples of this kind occur in the Tragic
poets. See Monk's Hippolytus, 280, who observes, that the praepositive
article with μέν, γάρ, δέ, is osten put for ἐκεῖνος. This is true in these
cases, buthe has not noticed the whole peculiarity, viz. that in general
there is a direct construction, in place of which, in our own language, we
should usually employ the relative. The Latin language, on the other
hand, very commonly uses a relative at the beginning of a fresh period,
where a demonstrative would be expected3 as, cujas reprehensio me
vehementer monet, Cic. pro Muren. 2. 3: quoe si consa aon esset, tamen
