same time. ln one point of view the‘ ο νικῶν, given above, will
illustrate the use of the nominative absolute, and it is probable
that we may, in some such way, explain the uae of the aomina-
tiorupeadcas ιιι other Greek writers. as, τα πολλὰ δὲ πόλει προ-
κόψασζ οὒ πόνον πολλοῦ με δεῖ, Eurip. Hippoi. 22, where see
Monk’s note tand other references, AEach. Suppl. 455. Choeph.

Eurip. Phoen. 290.

(a) 05515155 absol ute. (lases of this sort are sufficiently nnme-
rous. Thus we have in the New Testament among others, αὐτ οὔ
ἐνθυμηθέντος ἐφόνη αὐτῷ, Μ555. 1. 203 also ibid. ix. 18.
Mark v. 18. ἱιι. 9. John viii. 30.

(b) Dotive absolute. The following example will suffice, ἐξελ-
θόντι δέ αὐτῷ ὑπήντησεν αὐτῷ, Luke 511127. Here, how-
ever, the correspondency 51555 cases is merely accidental, and
1 object to the view which makes αὐτῷ merely redundant.

(c) Aceruntiae absolute. Here, likewise, from the agreement of Ι

555 cases, it may be supposed 5555 555 first accusative is governed‚
and that the second is redundant; but this is, in my view, also
merely accidenta13 thus, εἰσελθόντα αὐτὸν oi μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ

Oba. This practice is not confined to αὐτός, 555555 5555 extended to
other pronounS. Thus, we have τούτων δέ πορευομένων ἤρξατοὸ
Ἰησοῦς λέγειν ταῖς ὄχλοις, Mau. xi. 7: εἰσελθόντων t μῶν συνάν-
τὴσει ὑμῖν, Luke xxii. 1οι ὄντος μου μεθ’ ὑμῶν, orit ἐξετείνατε τὰς
χεῖρας ἐτ’ ἐμέ, ibid. xxii. 53. ln the following, the accusative absolute
appears to follow, instead of preceding as usua13 thus, ὑπομνῆσαι δὲ
ir μᾶς βοόλσμιιι, εἰδότας ὑμᾶς, Jude i. 5. St. Paul uses ὑμᾶς redun-
dantly, Philip. i. 7 3 and έμοί 15 like marmer, Rom. vii. 213 and again,
circ καὶ ἐκάλεσεν ἡμᾶς, 1105515245 οἷς ἐν ὑμῖν, Gal. 111. 2, where
some MSS. omit the personal pronoun, which instance might have been
classed with those above, where relative and demonstrative are exhibited
in the same member. Of this double pronominal use, we have another
example 15 the Septuagint, Gen. κ’. 6, ἐφεισάμην σου τοῦ μὴ ἁμαρτεῖν
σε εἰς ἐμέ.

p 24.-Τ55 practice treated ofin the last section, though much
more common in later writers, and, 55 we have seen, very general
in the Alexandrian and Hellenistic writers, is not unknown among
the best. Thuri, τοότου μέλλοντος λέγειν ἆτήλασεν αὐτὸν ἡ
