'lua following Work is a roprint, greatly enlargcd and corrected,
⁸ of a pamphlet publishcd some few years back by the Author, and
has so far lost its original form and gained in illustration, that it
’ may be regarded as altogether new. ltis not a mere compilation

. Ι of the labours os other scholars, as, indeed, will be apparent on

’ slight inspection. It would have been easy to have rendered the
volume more complete by further reference to the many gram-
matical authorities who have travelled partly over the same
ground3 but this has been avoided, it being quite needless to mul·
tiply works of merc extract, while the originale are so accessible as
they are. The Author puts it forward merely as a collection ot'
examplcs furnished by his own reading, and such occasional com-
mentarios as arc to be met with in modern editions of the classica,
. noted down at the time, *and afterwards arranged„ If these pages
have any value at all, that-valuewill not be diminishcd by their
having originated iu this way, or from t'ew authorities having boen
consulted3 neither will it be objected, by any person os sufficient
judgment, that the range of quotation is too limited, and confined
principally to authors read commonly in schools, since it is within
this range-chiefly that it is meant to be of use.

' With regard to many oi the examples, quoted in the course of
these pages, different editors have adopted different readings or
conjectures, for the purpose os obviating difficulties, real or sup-

* posed, which arc probably, alter all, unnecessary. lt is true, that
if we suppose some oi these emendations to be based on sufficient
authority, these examples may not always bear upon the support oi

the uews for which they are here exhibited. The Author's object
