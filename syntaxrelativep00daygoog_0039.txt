to his edition. ι11 was of earlier occurrence, however, in Doric writers,
and its use in, legal formnlae is in favour of its antiquity. How this
usage originated, it is perhaps impossible to say 3 but it may be thought
to bear some analogy to the phrase ἔστιν ά and its cases, which are used in
asomewhat similar way. Thus, in the following, ἔτι δὲ καὶ ἐν τοῖς βαρ-
βάροις ἔστιν οἷς νῦν, Thucyd. i.6; and again, τῆς τε ἄλλης Ἑλλάδος
ἔστιν οἳ χωρία, ibid. i. 12. St. Paul uses the ὃς μέν form in his
epistles in three different ways3 first, as answering to ὃς δέ, as καὶ ὃς
μὲν πεινᾷ ὃς δὲ μεθόει, 1 Cor. xi. 21; secondly, opposed to ἄλλος δέ,
’ ιε’-ηδ μὲνγὰρ, θλλρ δὲ, 1 Cor. xii. 8 3 and thirdly, without the second or
contrasted member, as καὶ οὓς μὲν ἔθετο πρῶτον ἀποστόλοις δεότερον
ι.τ.λ. ibid. xii. 28. Itis at least curious, that the English language '
should have retained this use of the relative for the partitive adjective, or
something which very closely resembles it. Thus, ‘And such a dood of
greamess fell on you, What with our help, wh at with the absent king,
what with the miseries of a wanton time,’ Shakesp. Ι. Henry IV. actv.
sc. 1, where ‘what’ might be supplied by ‘partly’ It is not always
easy to decide, however, whether Homer is using what is termed the
article, demonstrative, or relative pronoun. Thus, take for example,
μνησάμενοι τὰ ἕκαστος ε’νὶ μεγάροισιν ἔλειπον, Hom. ll. r'. 339. Here,
if we allowed Homer the use of the article, and considered the construction
as detennined by the sense, we might put herespem in place of the sen-
tence following rd: or we may consider the relative θ to be elliptical, aud
τά as put for ταῦταε or we may suppose that the demonstrative is wanting,
so commonly the case in Greek, and rbat τά is the relativesupplying its
place. The article differs from the relative in the later form of declension,
chiefly by the former retaining the initial τ through most of the oblique
cases, while the latter always commences with the aspirated vowel. In
the Doric dialect, however, the initial r was preserved in the nominative
plural of the article, proving that, like the relative form, it has experienced
a change of its original form, by dropping it in some of the dialects.
Thus, ταὶ Διωνύσου πόθεν ἐξέφανεν σῦν βοηλάτᾳ χάριτες διθνράμβμς
Pind. Olymp. xiii. 18: d τ’ Ἐλευσῖς-τ αἱ θ’ ὑπ’ Αἰτνης ὑψιλόφου καλ·
λίπλουτοι πόλιες, d τ’ Εὔβοια, Pind. 01μιῐιμ.ιιίἰί. 110, where talte ά for
the article, and not the neuter plural of the relative. This passage is
quoted by Matthiae in his Grammar, as exemplifying the use of the article
with proper namesr also rat ὄχθαι, Pind. Pyth. i. 18. And, on the
other hand, we have the τος form bf the relative pronoun in other positions
than the initia] one, where we cannot resort to the supposition that the
direct structure is put in place of that by the relative; as, δέξαι δέ οἱ
στεφάνων ἐγκώμιον τεθμόν, τὸν ἄγει πεδίων εἰι Πίσας πεντάθλῳ ἅμα
σταδίου νικῶν δρόμον· ἀντεβόλησεν τῶν ἀνὴρ θνατὸς οὔπω τις πρότερον,
Pind. Olymp. xiii. 29, ‘and receive from him the customary comus
which he conducts from the plains of Pisa, having conquered in the
stadium and quinquertium, which never mortal man before obtained!
The τος and ὃς form occur together in two contrasted members of a sen·
tence, in their partitive use, in the following: τοὶ μὲν γένει φίλῳ cdv
Ἀτρέος Ἑλέναν κομίζοντες, oi d' ἀπὸ πάμπαν εἴργοντες, Pind. Olymp.
xiii. 58, ‘some with the offspring of Atreus, whose friends they were,
secking to carry back Helen, and others to prevent it’ In addition to
using ῥά in common, the relative and demonstrative both take μέν and δέ,
as τὰμὲν, Pind. Olymp. xi. 7, occurring aster a point, for θ’ μὲν, agreeing
with ἀφθόνητος αἶνος as a noun of multitude, and Pyth. i. 21. They
