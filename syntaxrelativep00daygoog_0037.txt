condidit admi-yenit, et moltomorte recepit, AEn. ix. 3472
ἧς νῦν ἔχονται κᾶπαναίρονται δόρυ, OEdip. Colon. 420, ‘respecting
this battle which they are now preparing to begin, and in which
they are lifting their spears against each other? Wunder com-
pares with this, qaam (ennom) moeni incautam nemora inter
Cresia finit pastor apetie telis, liquitque volatile ferrem
nendos, Virg. AEn. iv. 71. It is convenient to explain all these
cases, by supposing the relative assumed mentally, which we do
naturally enough in endeavouring to accommodate the construction
to au English one. But we might put the rnle differently, aud
lam not sure that it would not be better to do so, by stating,
that aster a relative pronoun, when two verbs coupled-by a con-
junction occur, the second is not required to be in construction
with the relative. This mode of representing the matter appears
to meto agree better with the sreedom of construction, which the
Greeks particularly observed iu many other cases, and which is not
to be explained by inferring that they did this, or omitted to do
that, which we now do in English. ln all reasonings of this sort,
it must be recollected, that although we may explain on the
analogy os our own tongue‚ and while this may suffice for
furuishiug a rule which is intelligible, we must not assert that this
furnishes a clue in all cases to the origin of a given practice.

(f) lite relative ond demonstrative clonae meited into one'. 'l'his
usually takes place after the interrogative relative pronoun, the
relative of the explanatory member being absorbed. Thus, qn is
novas liic matois manescit aedibus hospes? Virg. AEn. iv. 10,
sor quis est aie nomn hospes qni: similarly we have qnid hoc
veneni sevit in precordiis? Hor. Epod. iii. 5, for qnid est ior
veneid qnod : and the practice is very usual in Greek3 as, ὅστις
ὅδε κρατέει ; Hom. ll. π’. 424, ‘who he is that is thus prevailingi'
τί ς ποθ’ ἥδ’ ὁμήγυρις, AEsch. Ohoeph.10: καὶ νῦν ri τοῦτ’ αὖ
φασὶ πανδήμῳ πόλει κήρυγμα θεῖναι τὸν στρατηγὸν ἆρτίως; Soph.
Antig. 7, ‘what is this proclamation which they say i' ποῖον
γὰρ ἀνδρὸς τήνδε μηνύει rixam Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 102, for ποίου
γὰρ ἀνδρὸς ’ἐστιν ἥδε ἡ τύχη, ἣν μηνύει. See also Eurip. Phoen.
145, τ ἴς δ’ οὗτος περᾷ ; Itis not, however, wholly confined to
the interrogative3 as, nt aiiii in iis non appareat. Incert. for nihil
est qood. This is done with the adjectives primae, princeps, used

² Even with the demonstrative, where no relative appears, this is done;
as, tanto 1ωο laetitio oborto est, Ter. Heaut. iv. 3, 2, ‘so great is this
joy which has ariscn.’
