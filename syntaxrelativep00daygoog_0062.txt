cases, the adjective must be regarded aa making up one notiora
with the verb, which is accordingly haben fidelissimam, lechem
corun, and so forth. There are some combinatione of qni with
colen and amn, in which there is nothing remarkable, as the
relative pronoun admits freely this connexion3 as, cni nni,
Nepos, in Dion, 5: quem annm, ibid. Eumen. 2: just aa hnic nni,
ibid. 'limoth 2: unum quem docuit, Virg. AEn. v. 704: quoe
primos Nomidc invaserunt, Liv. xxi. 47: ὃν ἐτύγχανεν ’ἔχων
κήρυκα ἄριστον, Anab. ii. 2, 20. Sometimes this practice is
extended by a further qualification3 as, un crem co, qni primur
rc obtulisset Romanos exercitur, Liv.xxi.29, where wehave
also an illustration of the transferred antecedent, for crem co erer-
citn qui. This use of the adjective in the relative clause is so
much a favourite with Roman writers, that it may almost be
regarded in the light of a rulc which is obligatory on the writer of
elegant Latin. Besides the examples just given, we have another
class occurring with the adjectives, mediae, reliquus, totus, par, and
probably some others, where in English we are forced to uae the
adverb3 as, quoe medios cohors pretorio diy'ccerct, Sall Cat.
61: lucus crat quem medinm, Liv. i. 21. Some editions read
also, qztoe inter med i o e, Virg. AEn. i. 352, and I think it perfectly
free from objection. Again, dier quem tn non to tum in icta ratione
consumptam, Cic. pro Muren. xxii. 46: tum omino peyna quum in
omnen parter parem intenderant, Liv. ii. 50. 'l'hus also in the
Latin phrase qni alins, and the Greek ὅστις ἄλλος, though some-
times ἄλλος precedes, as Xen. Anab. v. 5, 12, a thing of no
moment, for the similarity of case is preserved, as in the following,
ἑτέρῳ d' ὅτῳ κακόν τι δώσομεν Ζητεῖν, Dem. de Cor. ς’, where,
without recollecting the analogy, we should imagine an attraction
to have taken place, for ἕτερον δ’ ὅτῳ. The Greek admits another
kind of construction with the relative-which is not found in Latin,
but this it possesses in common with the demonstrative, and is
not peculiar to the relative merely; aa, οἷς γὰρ οὖσιν ὑμε-
τέροις ’ἔχει χρῆσθαι, τούτοις ἅπαντα τᾶλλα βεβαίως κέκτηται,
Dem. Philipp. Δ. δ’.

j 27.-1 must not conclude this chapter, without advertiug to
two or three other cases, in which a substantive is found in the
relative clause, in concord with the relative es an adjective, where
all trace of direct transference has disappeared, though, no doubt,
the origin of such uses is to be found in this practice. Thus we
have seen, that the Greeks, in a great many instances, differ from
the Latine, in the construction of their relative clauses, in such a
way as to strengthen this supposition. 'l'he first class of cases is
