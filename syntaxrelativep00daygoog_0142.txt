tut-When the relative clause is dependent on a verb iu the
subjunctive moad, and is essential to the sense of the main pro-
position, tben a subjunctive is found in it; as, 11011111 quem, puia-
mutuasset, arrad respicere uetitus esset, apitaret cumo, Liv.
xxi. 22. See also the 11111101 immediately above.

adeo, theu the indicative occurs in the relative clauses as, jars aera ita

injuriis essedicaalur, ut is, qai dignitate principibus excellit, saei-
litate par infimis uideatur, Cic. pro leg. Manil. 14. 41: Asia sero

2. A similar kind 01 attraction exists in Greek3 as, γόνιμα ποιητὴν
its abr εὕροις 's'rs ζητῶν ἄν, 11011ςρ11μο γενναῖον λάκοι, Aris-

b 95.-ln nearly all the cases here enumerated, it will be found
on examinatior, that the relative clause is indispensable to the
sense of the whole proposition to which it belongs, when the sub-
junctive is used in it, aud in other cases not specifically enu-
merated here, the rule may be applied with safety. There are
1 few cases of 1 different kind yet 10 be mentioned.

§96.—'ibe verbs cliro, puto, arbitror, are osten put by Cicero,
and occasionally by other writers, in the subjunctive mood, by 1
kind of 1111101101, where this mood properly belongs to the verb,
which expresses what was thought or said3 as, sed ubi Cosmum
ad tautum facinus impellere nequeunt, ipsi siugulatim circumeunda
atque ementiundo qu a se ea Volturcio aut Allobrogibus audisse
11 i 11 rea t, maguam illi iuvidiam conflaverant, Sall. 01149. 11111
the writer not used 11110, he would heve said properly qua 0111110111,
which, by reason 01 the subjunctive, would have meant, ‘what he
said he had heard 3' but he actually introduces dieo, and puts this
in the same moad, while, by reason 01 this change, the word that
would have been in the subjunctive is put into the structure ο1 the

accusative and infinitive, and turns over its mood to dico. See·
