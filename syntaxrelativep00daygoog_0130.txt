Nep. in Eum. 11 r eaque propiuspropius, 000010 01 00100 gener-ic
0000100000100100, Liv. xxi. 46, instances containing an imitation
of a well-known Greek construction. In all these, the subjunctive
follows, just 00 much as if the object of the first verb were made
the subject 01 the dependent verb. On the other hand, this trans-
ference does sometimes take place, both in Greek and Latin, where
the whole relative clause is not objective, and where we may with
propriety restore the lost object, by taking it back from the relative
clause3 as, quem dederat cursum fortuna percpi, Virg. AEn. iv. 653.

(b) There are two classes of instances in Latin, where the ante·
cedent substantive finds its place in the relative clause, in the one
cf which it may be removed, in the other nct3 but this generally
depends on the nature 01 the verb preceding. Thus, 1110110000
00010 Anchisen quis 110101 10000, Virg. AEn. vi. 669. Here the indi-
cative follows, and not the subjunctive, and rapio and 10000 may
both be made objective tc dicite. But in this, 0000000000 requirit
1000100 AEneoa, qaoe 0101 00 flumina porro quive 0101 complerint, ibid.
vi. 711, we could not make either flumina or 0101 objective to requi-
011. There is a further peculiarity in this passage, vin. that 000000
10 put as a direct object to requirit, while the relative clauses, con-

taining each a different subject, are properly such, and 000000 1

must be regarded as in apposition with them, or else the relative
clauses must be regarded as exegetical 01 caueae ln Greek, not
only is the subject 01 the objective relative 010000 transferred as
object to the preceding verb, but the structure 01 the relative
clause altered, as ἐπιστάμεθα γὰρ Μυσοὺς οἳ οἰκοῦσιν, Xen. Anah.
iii. 2, 23, for ὅτι οἱ Μυσοὶ οἰκοῦσιν. That this is the right con·
struction is clear from the sense of ἐπιστάμεθα, and tbe use 01 ὅτι
10 the same connexion lower down. Again‚ Μενέλεων δὲ πεύ-
θομαι, sl νόστιμός γε καὶ σεσωσμένος πάλιν, AEsch. Agam. 575.
At other times, in addition to this peculiarity, another clause is
made to intervene between the accusative and the clause to which
11 would in Latin be the subject3 aa, ὁρῶντος τοὺς στρατη-
γοὺς, 01 dul olorone αὐτοῖς ἑαυτοὺς ἐνεχεῐρισον, ola πεσόν-

θα σι ν, Xen. Anab. iii. 2, 8. Orthia subject 01 the relative clause
is even put in the accusative, before the clause by which it is
governed3 as, τὸν μὲν obre> φανερῶς ἆδικοῦντο, καὶ πόλεις roro·
λαμβάνοντα οὐδεὶς πώποτε τούτων εἶπεν ὡς ἀδικεῖ καὶ πόλεμον

ποιεῖ, Demosth. Philipp. Δ. ιε’.
