edisset, Caes, B. G. i. 29, for ejus numeri qui: οὐδὲν mi που κάτοισ-
θα τῶυ σαυτοῦ aripti βουλεύματ’ iari‚Soph. Philoct.
545: ipsarus, quam re pionem consui petisset, Liv. iv. 39:
οἶς ὁμόθεν sl eal γονᾷ Erinomae, οἵα Χρυσόθεμις ζώει καὶ Ἰφιάνασσα,
κρυπτᾷ τ’ α’χέων ἐν ἥβᾳ ὄλβιος, ὃν ἁ κλεινὰ γῖι ποτὲ Μυκηναίων
δέξεται εὐπατρίδαν Ὀρέσταν, Soph. Elect. 153, ‘with
whom you are of the same origin, and allied by birth, as for in-
stance, Chrysothemis who lives, and Iphianassa, and Orestes born
to be fortunate, though now passing his youth in solitude and
grief, whom the far-famed land of the Mycenaeans shall receive,
happily restored to his country! Similar instances with the proper
name in the relative clause, are the following: πρὸς ἄνδρ’ ὃς
ἄρχει τῆσδε Πολυ μή στ ωρ χθονός, Eurip. Hecub. 754: πρῶτον
pls εἰπὲ παῖδ’, δν ἐξ ἐμῆς χερδςΠολΰδ ωρου εἰ ζῇ, ibid.
965, where Πολύδωρον is in the same ease as satiabat still the
structure is really the same, as both ταῖς and the proper name
would, according to ordinary Latin or English syntax, be nomina-
tive to Ζῇ, though in a well-known Greek construction. Pflugk
quotes these passages also in a note to his edition, and adds Hom.
Odyss α’. 69. Eurip. Hippol. 101: ἐκ γένους δὲ δεῖ θανεῖν τοῦδ’,
ὃς δράκοντος γένυος ἐκπέφυκε παῖς, Eurip. Phoen. 940, sor
παῖδα ὃς. Α parallel Latin example is the followingz qai astas
ia libero populo inter jara leposque, ea qna arbe repes καυσίαν
sciret ea qua ia qao ia qua ἱα ea Sp.
M alias spem repsi conceperit, Liv. iv. 15. Here arbe is put
with pua instead of with ea, by reason of the long postponement
of the demonstrative3 common in passages of particular emphasis,
and the construction having passed from Maiiam to qai, the sub-
ject Sp. Melioris again expressed in the qai clause, to recol atten-
tion atter the long parenthesis to that subject. Again, ande haba?
qaam Bacchis secum addarit adulescentulam, Ter. Heaut. iv. l,
41, ‘from the young woman whom Bacchis brought with her :'
qaod paidom jas civite didicisti, aon dicam operam perdidisti,

, cie. pro Muren. 10. 23: qaod populas ia se jas dederit, eo caa-

salem asarum, Liv. iii. 9: risere pestiens qua parte debacchentur
ipses, Hor. od. iii. 3, 54: pais aaa maloram paca amor caras
habet, ibid. Epod. ii. 37, which is curious, from the separation os
the adjective malarum from its substantive caras. Two other
singular instances are the following: pone me qaod latas, Hor.
Od. i. 22, 17, for pone me in eo tatere qaod, and reperiebat etiam ia
querendo Cesar, qaod proetiam equestre adversam paucis aste
diebas esset factam, initiam egias firpa saetam a Dumnoripe, Caes.
B. G. i. 18, where qaod prelium is put in place of ia eo pretio
