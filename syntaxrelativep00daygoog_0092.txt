dc Nat. Deor. i. 44, and also to some cases of the accusative and
infinitiva! And speaking of the Relative, in the construction of
the Accusative and Infinitive, “in point of fact, this use of the
relative is closely analogous to the one named above. lsits place is
supplied by is and the copulative conjunctim, we have at once a

usage which is strictly correct3 but thia use os the relative itself
is not consistent with its own natural power3 or, at least, the
instances of the kind we have brought forward, contain deviations
from the primitive value of the relative, which, at length, became
recognized as legitimate, and must now be considered as such.'’
The examples quoted, as illustrating ‘ Anacoluthon,’ were the fol-
lowing= qni si alicujus injuria sibi cmndussaiscct, noa fcisse
difficile cocere, Caes. B. G. i. 143 quc ia quo aon sant, ia
firmi stomachi est, Cels. i. 18; qai sijaoissent, se codem
loco qao Helvetios habitarum, Caes. B. G. i. 26. Habet
populus Romanus od qnos gubernaculo reipublice deferm ; qui cbi-
cunque terraram cuot5 ibi est omae reipublice presi-
dium, oelpoticc ipra respublica, Cic. Orat. Philipp. ii. 44:
que ac clema illia licentia rit, legem sepromulpatcram,
Liv. iii. 93 and so also, qui utrum αυανίον aa cmdelior cit, vic¹
estimari potest, Liv. xxii. 59 ¹. ln a similar way, qood is followed
by an accusative and infinitive, where the editors mark it as an
adverb, in my opinion quite inaccurately‚ both here and in many
other cases, some of which have been noticed elsewhere. Thus,
quod si quidet a Cerere yronica accidisset, ᾄσῃ· neminem ec-
ia limaturam non aaa volantatefcctam, Caes. Β. G. i. 20. The
qood is here not ‘that' it being improper to use it with the Accu-
sativc and Infinitive, unless we justify this by reason of the
‘oblique oration,' or the Greek use of dn, which sometimes occurs
in this way. If, however, we render it by et id, in construction
with factum esse, regarding the id as the subject olfactum, all diffi-
culty is removed. I have not the slightest doubt, that the adver-
bial use of qood, in the sense os ‘but,' at the commencement of a
period, has originated in this way, as it is frequently followed by
si. According to my view, an adverbial relative form is one which
often represents all cases at pleasure, and it isvery easy to sub-
stitute a copulative conjunction and a case of the demonstrative
for qood, in the sense named. But this is not requisita 3 for even
in the use of quiin this way, its force, as a subject, is evidently on

¹ In English we do not use the relative as subject in dependent clauses.
