qui ca. The construction is δηλοῦτον σε ὃς εἶ for ὃς σὺ εἶ, a well·
known construction3 only we have ὄνθ’ transferred as well, for ἃς
σὺ el ὦν; so we have in conformity with this σὺ γάρ μ’ ὅς εἰ μι,
εἰρηκὼς κυρεῖς, ibid. 570.

§tta-ln the use of τις, ὅστις, and words put partitively, we
find the singular used continually in reference to a plural ante-
cedent or subject. We have elsewhere scen the use of quisque
singular, in apposition with a plural, and also a similar use of
ἕκαστος, olias alios, ἄλλος, and the practice here alluded to depende
on similar considerations. Thus, τοῖς πᾶσιν ὅστις, Soph. Electr.
1480. Eurip. Alcest. 368. ibid. Phoeniss. 390. Hom. ll. ρ’. 631,
and so μηδείς in the singular ir followed by the plural, Phoeniss.

but the demonstrative pronoun, ἕως μὲν ἂν παρῇ τ ι ς, χρῶμαι. . . .
συλλαβὼν αὐτοὺς, Xen. Anab. i. 4, 8: οἶσθ’ οὖν ἃ λέξαι σοί τε ·
καὶ παισὶν θέλοις οὐκ olla· τῷ σῷ τοῦτο σημανεῖς λόγῳ, Eurip.

in a different gender from its subject, and drawa the relative aster

βούλει, κ. τ. λ., ibid. 981. The expression εἴτις is used in the
singular with a plural antecedent, or as in the second annexed
example, the plural is abruptly abandoned on its introduction: εἴ
τις φίλος ἦν βαρβᾶρων τούτων ἀπειχόμεθα, Xenoph. Anah. v.
5,14: oi δὲ ἄλλοι ἇπώλοντοχιόνος, καὶ ei τις νόσῳ, ibid.
v. 3, 3. The genitive plural indicates frequently a class, and hence
it is osten connected with a word in the singular that designates
one of that class, though the genitive plural is not dependent on
that word in the singular by the rule of partitives. Thus, ὥσπερ
oi τὰ σκολύθρια τῶν μελλόντων καθιζήσεσθαι ὑποσπῶντες
χαίρουσι καὶ γελῶσιν, ἐπειδὰν ἰ’θωοιν ὕπτιον ἀνατετραμ-
μένον, Plat. Euthyd. 278, C, ‘as those who secretly withdraw
their scats from those who are about to sit down on them, laugh
and exult when they see the persons sprawliug on their backs?
So also πάντων ἀνθρώπων σβέσσαι μένος ὃς, Hom. ll. π’. 621. Ι
have elsewhere noticed that the relative, in somewhat similar con-
structione, is in reality in agreement with the partitive demon-
’ strative, on which the genitive plural depends3 and this seems to
have been cxtended to other cases like this, where the genitive
plural is merely the latter of two substantives. But, in fact, let
the genitive plural occur how it will, whether in or out of a
partitive construction, it is always susceptible of being connected
with the relative, or occasionally other words, partitively, instead
of requiring them to follow in the plural. The genitive plural
