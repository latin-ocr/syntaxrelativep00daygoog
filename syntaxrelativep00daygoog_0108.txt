have been thought to prove that these forms of the relative are taken
immediately from aliquis. Regarding aliquia as a compound of olins and
quir, with which the verb snm may be understood, and taking the instance
above given, rte qui proeter tyrannos afficerentur exilio, we could explain
it thus, ne essert alii qut, of which the essent alti might be lest to be

was donbtless horrowed from the mode in which quis the indglfignitetgm
declined-quis, qna, qnid. This is sar more rational than to suppose that
aliqua was peculiarly the feminine form of aliquis, and that the form
εἰ qno was obtained from it, by dropping the first part of the compound
in this collocation. We have still to account for the existence of the
forms qui, qnae, qood in this arrangement, which cannot be done better
perhaps than by supposing‚ that as the forms qui and quis have so many
inflexions in common, both came to be used indifferently in certain cir-
cumstances and accordingly qaid and qood are interchanged in other
cases. Si qui is however more common with the indicative, and si quis is
usually put in objective clauses, though this is by no means unifmm, as,

FALSE CONCORD OF THE waharma-1¹18. SYLLEPSIS·

h tta-The agreement of the relative is sometimes disturbed by
attraction from that with its immediate antecedent, into agreement
· with the whole sentence, or with some other word of dfferertt
gender expressed or understood, or implied in apposition with the
antecedent. On the other hand, it is sometimes made to agree
with a particular word, where it should have taken the whole
sentence as its antecedent, as it does in the followingr hic uxorem
nunquam ducit irr qao reprehenderetur, Nep. in Epam. 10, where
quo is properly neuter, and is referred to the whole uotion con·
tained in the preceding proposition.

(o) Constructiorr according to eone. The following cases of this
false concord are· quoted by Anthou in his Horace: fatale mort-
strom que, Hor.Od. i. 37,21= obi illic estractus qui me
(perdidit), Ter. And. iii. 5, l: duo importuoia prod i pio quos,
tyr. Cio. To which I may add, insidior ei fecerum qui, Nep.
in Alcib. 9.

(b) Apreemeot with α particular word rather thart the whole
rtott'orr. of the second kind of usage, where we should expect the
relative to be in the neuter¹ gender, the subjoined examples will
suffice: corono a popolo doto eet quc oollam habuit invidiam,
