always denotes a collective body, to one individual of which the
relative may be referred, and not improperly so; for it is not meant
in the passage from Plato, that all who are ever placed in this pre-
dicament are collectively laughed at, but each as it may happen to

him3 and in that from Homer, it is not meant that the person
referred to was to subdue the whole collectively, but any of the
number taken consecutively‚ one by one. The plural demon-
strative is common in Plato with the singular relative 3 as, ri ταῦτας

§oo-Remum os oportitive. The relative pronoun, both in
Greek and Latin, isin very common use as a partitive, as, veni od
te qui plurima mulo omnium Groecorum intuli, Nep. in
Them. 9: καὶ τῶν β a ρ β ά ρ ω u oi re ἐν τῇ ἠπείρῳ παραθαλάσσιοι,
Thucyd. i. 5 ε ἔταξαν ἅς τε ’ἔδει παρέχειν τῶν πόλι ω ν χρήματα
καὶ ἃς ναῦς, ibid. i. 96: qui Volscorum effugere potuerunt Αιι·
tium petunt, Liv. ii. 65: qui sorte P α t ru m infero eruat tum ιἰι
eam turbem inciderunt, ibid. ii. 23: ξὺν ᾧπερ εἶχον οἰκετῶν
πιστῷ μόνῳ, Soph. OEdip. Col. 330: quem aaa incusavi amau
hominumque Deumque? virg.AEn.ii.745= quem Divum?
Hor. 0d. i. 2, 25: quis Deorum Ρ Virg. AEn.vi. 341: ὅσπερ προσπό-
λων, soph.Aj.533: quidquid Deorum ocmrrit,Liv.ii.49:
‘E λ hri ν ω ιι ὅσ οι Ευνεισέβησαν, Eurip.Med.473: τῶν σκευῶν ὅσα,
Xen. Anah. v. 3, 1 ε qui borum—is cir optimus hebebatur, Caes. Β. C.
lii. 12: dc θ’ ἡγεμόνων κακὸς, ὅς τέ νυ λαῶν, Hom. ll. β’. 365.

Obs. 1. This practice is explained by the supposition of ellipsis, and
transference of the genitive plural depending on the elliptical demonstrative
into the relative clause, at least this will always suffice to make the con-
struction intelligible3 but the Greeks, just as in a general way they make
the relative clause more directly objectiva to the preceding verb than the
Latina, a point which we have before established, also make the relative
in the use we are at present discussing more commonly a partitive. Thus
ln the instance, ἔταξαν ἅς τε ἔδει r ὦ ν π <iheu ι’, the τῶν πόλεων might
have been τὰς πόλεις after ἔταξαν, bnt it is transferred, and made to
depend on the relative, while dc takes its place, and in Greek may be as
⁴well made to depend on ἔταξαν, as on ἔδει, which is properly the governing
word. So in ἀποσπάσας o‘t' μοι παρῆσαν ἐλπίδων ἔτι, Soph. Electr.
796, ἐλπίδων might have been placed as accusative to ἀποσπάσαι.
