(α) The grave accent has been purposely lest over the last syllable of
the last word of several of the Greek examples quoted in this work, to
iudicate that the quotation is incomplete.

(β) page 4. 5 1, Oba. 1. lt might be argued, that, if currebat were the
verb belonging to the relative clause, it would be in the subjunctive like
ferret, and that, therefore, it is the verb in the relative clause that is
elliptical, curreret. To this it may be objected, that lt causes great con·
fusion iu the disposition of the two clauses, and that it is preferable to
regard qui as the subject of currebat. ln effect, the two clauses may be
viewed as melted into one, and as the fact that he did run is intended to
be conveyed, the indicative is properly used, while at ferret the ordinary
construction appears. That this is correct, will be seen from the great
awkwardness of supposing the construction to be saepe currebat velat qui
fugiens (for superet) hostem ,· persaepe velot qui lunonis sacra
se r r e t, where the participle does not correspond with the finite mood.

(γ) page 9. ᾖ 4, Obs. 2. The following Greek example may be added:
Ἀτρείδης δ’ dv' ὅμιλον ἐφοίτα, e'i που ἐσαθρήσειεν Ἀλέξανδρον θεοειδέα,
Hom. Il. γ’. 449.

(δ) page 16. § 19. Similar to the Greek example here given, in which
the subject and predicate appear to change places, is the subjoined Latin
one: huic autem qui studeant suot nelli, Cic. Off. i. 37 . So ulla esse
potyrisset, ibid. ii. 3: homines certe suerum, ibid. ii. 4: nullo csse potuisset,
ibi .

for the relative structure in St. John, though different in several respecta
from the one occurring c. xv. v. 6. lallude to the one c. v. vv. 37, 38:
“ And the Father himself which hath sent me, hath borne witness 'of me.
Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape,
and ye have not his word abiding in you, for whom he hath sent,
him ye believe not.” The meaning, obviously, appears to be this, ‘And
the Father himself which bath sent mc, hath borne witness of me, whose
voice though ye have neither heard, nor seen him iu a bodily shape, yet
ye have nothis word abiding in you, because ye believe not him whom ho
heth sent ς’ i. e. their determined unbelief preventcd their receiving the
fact of his divine mission, of which the evidence was abundant This
must be the meaning and connexion, though it is possible that our Lord
had iu view at the time the passage, Dent. iv. 12, “ Ye heard the voice of
the words, but saw no similitude, only a voice.” Compare also Heb. i. 2.
Α somewhat different case, though still referahle to the same principle, is
