inimici,· itemque alii, qui quidvis perpetiantur, cuiuis deser-
uia nt, dum quod uelint consequuntur. ln the first limb of this sentence,
putent would be as improper as in the second, perpetiuntur and deserviunt.
Alteratious of this nature, in consonuity to the grammatica} notions of
copiers and editors, are more difficult to effect in poetry. Thus, Lucre-
tius 111115, eet aliud quod aqitatur et accipit.- ibid. vi. 703,
aunt aliquot quarum dicere non eatis eet: Horat. Od. i. 7, 5, nunt
quihus opus est.’' Thus far the editor referred to above. 1 may
remark, however, thatin three of these examples alius or aliquot is inter-
posed, which, taken in their connexion, as in the case of nonnulli and multi
quoted above, osten imply a more specific reference than the simple phrase
sunt qui. The use of the subjunctive perpetiantur above, is, by Valpy’s
own showing, dependent ou other consideratione than those involved in the
mere use ol sunt qui, and it will not therefore be thought that 1 am con-
tradicted by his example, where aller alii the subjunctive does occur.
The first alii may have had a definite reference, and the second have been
wholly general. 1 only remark, that when alius is used, this reference is
very osten definite, and the indicative is used accordingly.

q eru-The relative is always put with the subjunctive aster the
expressions quia est? quid eet? used interrogatively3 as, quis eet,
qui se, cum eontra me serebatur, inisse euffraqium confiteo tur?
quie eet, qui nonprositeaturee affiniaque? Cicpro Sext.

Oba. And thus continually in the same author. This rule, of course,
applica to all the inflexione of the phrase quir eet qui? In Greek we use
the indicative 3 as, ric ὧδ’ ἄτρωτος ὅστις οὒκ ἀποίσεται, Eurip. Phoen. 5943
but also sometimes the optative, with or without du, as Plat. Euthyd.
292, E. 293, A. To prevent mistake, it may be observed, that the rule
holds good only when the phrase quie est qui is wholly in the interrogative
member3 as a question is sometimes asked by quis est, and answered by ·
quiin the redditive member, which is of course a different case. Thus,
uir honus est quis? qui consulta patrum, qui lepes, juraque serrat, Hor. Ep.
i. 16, 40.

ξ 88.-’1Ὶιε relative is put with the subjunctive in cases where
it is englished by ‘ to,' ‘as to,' in the phrases diqnue qui, idoneus
qui, tre. Instances of this sort are easily understood 3 for, in a
general way, if we render by the word ‘ that: we require to use the
potential in English. Thus, iudiqnue qui possid eant, Hor.
