govemed by μετάσχοιεν and μεταδοῖεν, and not by αὶτεῐτε and προῄρηνται,
the verbs respectively belonging to the same clause, whose usual govem-
ment is an accusative. So τῶν or’rr ἐναντιωθέντων olc ἔτραπεν, ibid. κ’.
πᾶσιν οΙς’ ἐκεῖνος ἔτραπεν, ibid. xu'. Hence a Latin writer given to
Greek imitation, as Horace, says, destrictus ensis cui super impio cervice
pendet, non Siculae dapes elaborabant, Od. iii. l, 17, rather than cajus,
becauoe of the implied case of illi,· though, of course, the dative can he
put attributively‚ in lieu of the genitive, by the ordinary rules of syntax.
For the further practice of the Greeks in this respect, which, as 1 have
said, is very general, consult Matthiae’s Gr. Gr. j 473, or any of the
Grammars. That the relative in these Greek examples is govemed,
rather than attracted, is pretty clear from the fact, that we rarely, or
perhaps never, find this take place in any hut the oblique cases. Thus
the relative pronoun, which is properly objective to the verb in its own
clause, does not osten become nominative, because the antecedent to which
it has reference is so. lt is only after agovemed antecedent, which is
therefore in one of the oblique cases, that this takes place, and hence
Ι conceive it is more correct to regard the relative as govemed. Ι need
hardly say, that this practice occurs very much more rarely among Latin
than Greek writers3 and the reason evidently is, that with the latter the
relative had, to a great extent, superseded the demonstrative clause, or
taken its place and undergone its construction; so that we can hardly
regard the demonstrative portion as elliptical‚ and for the same reason
tthttttttttdtfttt? ti bittit {tttttfttitttt‘tt
it is at variance with the syntax of the language. When they use a
relative clause in lieu of the direct object, the construction shows that
nothing takes place beyond ellipsis3 while in those cases, in which the
relative clause is itself the proper object of the verb, the relative is still in
the usual construction, with its verb in the subjunctive mood.

(d) Antecedcnt in the carc of the Reicitur, but not in its chose:
Attruction. A very remarkable instance occurs in this exemplet
οὐκοῦν εἰ μὴ ἐπιστήμῃ εὐδοξίᾳ δὴ τὸ λοιπὸν γίγνεται, ᾗ οἱ
πολιτικοὶ ἄνδρες χρώμενοι, enh. Plat. Men. 99, C, where the
attracted word is at some distance from the relative, but where
some editors have ventured to put the nominative without suffi-
cient warrant. See Stallbaum. As I mentioned above, the
instances, Plat. Men. 99, C. Soph. OEdip. Col. 1145. Dem. de
Coron. vd. Xen. Anab. iii. 1, 7. might be classed under this head3
but, in all, the antecedent and relative are in close juxta-position.
A very much more unusual species of attraction, than any Ι have

named, is that by which the antecedent, though it is required to
be in the nominative, as nominative to the verb, is drawn into the
case of the relative3 as, arbem quom statuo vestra est,
Virg. AEn. i. 577. This passage is somewhat similar to qaas credis
esre has non sawt vnce nuptia, quoted above, and also quem
locam Trojn vocatam but in both these the demonstrative
follows the relative. For further examples os this kind, see
