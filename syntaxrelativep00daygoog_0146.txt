met with Rev. i. 16, ἡ ὄψις αὐτοῦ ὡς ὁ ἥλιος φο l ν ει ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αἰετοῦ,
where we might say that there is an ellipsis of the relative adverb and
pronoun, ‘his countenance was as the sun when he shineth in his
strengtlr,' but where sur translators have faithfully imitated the original, as
usual, even to the form of construction. This is not, however, a case of
ellipsis, since it is manifest, by comparison with other passages, that the
φαίνει is put in lieu os the participle φαίνων, justas in the example quoted

exartiple oi the direct construction, where resort musi be had to some
similar explanation. .

(ζ) page 19. p 19, (c). St. Paul uses the article for the relative pro·
nouo, in this verse, τῷ ιόν φόρον, τὸν φόρον· τῷ rd τέλος, τὸτέλος· τῷ
τὸν φόβαν, τὸν φόβον· τῷ τὴν τιμὴν, τὴν τιμήν, ‘tribute to whom tri-
bute,' ‘honour to whom honour,’ Rom. xiii. 7· There is here, more-
over, an attraction in the first accusative of each member, though it is
’ possible to explain the passage differently, and I arn inclined to think that
rt would be better to ragard τῷ as the article preceding aparticiple sup-

ressed, whose meaning is that of ‘having a claim to‚' which governs the

brat accusative, the second accusative being in apposition with ὀφειλάς, or
goverued by ἀπόδοτε in the former partos the verse. Could we justify
the uae ol' ὀφείλω as an active verb, in the sense not os ‘owing’ but σι’
‘having something owed,’ this explanation would be quite satisfactory.

dr, where the absence of the conjunctiora δέ οι τε would soem to intimate
that the construction is really relative, and not demonstrative, and where
the tenninnl ς is lest out for the sake of the metre. See Hom. Il. γ’. 351,
854, also linc for ὅστις, τ’. 265, and elsewhere ὅτε sor ὅστε, ὅπερ for ὅσπερ.

(6)page24.§19. Tbat the spiritus asper was osten equivalent to
what is termed the digamma, may be shown by the Latin orthography of
frater, frango, of cognate origin with some Greek words commencing with
ῥ, from the sact that it osten renders hiatus admissible in Homer in a
similar way; aud from its being, in some Latin relative forms, represented
by q orqu, the modern ια, as may be seen in ‘whom,’ ‘when' dcc„ in

sented by a sound intermediate between the harsh sibilant s, aud the sotter
breathing h, such as t. This is seen in ror' for σοι’, θάλαττα sor θάλασσα.
In correspondency with this we have τις, Latin quis, ὄατις, quisquis, τε,
que. This will suffice ιο show, that the attempt to connect ὅ, ὅς, τός, hic,

ὅς is used for relative and demonstrative, and coupled with μέν, δέ, for
ὁ μέν, ὁ oi: and thath, q, c, are frequently only mnks of a breathing,
either preceding some unsnpported vowel-sound, or following it as sorne-
thing upon which ιο rest. It might not be difficult to connect is, abror,
