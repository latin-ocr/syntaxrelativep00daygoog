or qaod, in several ordinary constructions. The two senses of
⁴ that' and ‘because' assigned to ὅτι, 010 at once explained by the
following ellipses, expressed in the parentheserr ‘ Irejoice (in the
lact) that,' ‘I rejoioe (in the cause) that’. So qood, in Latin, ad-
mits 01 01101101 explanation, as it does also when it signifies ‘as to
the sect that,5 or qnod attinet od id, or ‘wherefore,' as in the pas-
sage, quod te obsecro redde, Hor. Epist. i. 7, 94: 00001 te per
oro, Virg. AEn. vi. 3622 quod 0001 eloquar, Ter. Heaut. Prolog. 3.

Obs. 1. Some of the adverbial forms retain the declinable ending, so as
to leave no doubt of their origin. Sueh are ἅτε, καθάπερ, οἷον, οἷα, ὅπερ,
οὗ, οὗπερ, ol, ᾖ, ᾗπερ, quod, qaam, 000, 000, ἃ, rt ¹. All or most 01 these
admit of explanation by ellipsis3 as, σχὲς οὗπερ εἴ, Soph. OEdlp. col.
1164, analogous to ἵνα τόπου sl, in lieu 01 which the relative stands in the
same case. The following passages contain instances of some 01 these;
aa, οὗ μή ’στι καιρός, μὴ μακρὰν βούλου λέγειν, Soph. Electr. 1240: τί

- ttlf'ttl, ttltlttt‘tlttt tbtt.lttt·.,²>².›⁸.t{ttltttttt‘t‘lt
λαγῶμεν ἐκ τῶν θεῶν, Plat. Cratyl. 408, D. Even 01 these, some are
occasionally interchanged with each other; aa, altra qaam licet, Hor. Od.
iv. 11, 30, ι10 1100 01 quod, and formed on the analogy of praeterquam,
priusquam, &a There is another use 01 d, in a different sense from the
example immediately above, where we might supply its place by ὡςε as,
οὐδ’ d νῦν προφασίζεται οὗτος, Dem. de Conpd. On the use ofd δή
101 the more common ἅτε, olo aa, see Wunder’s Aj. 1016, who quotes
Dem. Epist. v. 1490, A. Plat. Phaedr. 224, Ε.

2. Where the declinable ending is no longer clearly recognized, in
consequence 01 the slightly-altered orthography, we can easily explain the
construction by ellipsis, and the restoration 01 the probable ending3 or
what is perhaps better, we are at liberty to suppose, thatin many instances
0 general or absolute form was invented, known as the adverbial, that
might suit for all cases. We may thus explain the uses of 0000, qaam,
which last osten occurs where the neuter qaod would best suit this mode
01 explanation, 001 in the sense 01 ‘how,’ ὡς, ὅτε, aad at in Latin, and
such phrases as 0000 00010οὡςτᾶχιστα. Thus, at, 10 the senses ‘as,'
‘how,’ ‘when,' ‘because,' ‘considering that,’ may stand respectively 101
00 modo 000, quomodo, eo tempore 000, 00 00000 000, while 10 the last

without our being necessitated to suppose, that ut was 00 wholly used in
the signification 01 ‘in order that’ as ἵνα 10 Greek. Or ἵνα may have had
, 0 wider sense itself in Greek, as there is some reason to suppose from its
use aller βούλομαι, θέλω, where it appears to have the same force exactly
as ὅτι. The New Testament uses 01 ἵνα, here spoken of, are such as
these: after ἐντολή, 1 John iii. 2³. iv. 213 after αὕτη, ibid. v. 33 aster
λέγω, ibid. v. 163 aster a comparative, followed by τούτων without ἢ,
3 John i. 43 01101 ποιέω, Rev. iii. 9. xiii. 123 01101 ἐῤῥέθην, Rev. vi. 11.
ix. 4; aster ἄξιος, John i. 27; and after ἔτοιμόζω, Rev. viii. 6.

¹ We may carry this further; thus, in the following passage, πότερα
δ’ ὀνείρων φ ά 0 μ α τ’ εὐπειθῆ sillem AEschyl. Agam. 249, the πότερα 10 10
agreement with φάσματα, though we commonly regard it 00 adverbial.
