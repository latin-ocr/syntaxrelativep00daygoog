subject: as, νῦν l ουκ εσθ oeric θάνατον φύγῃ ὅ ν κε defayt, Il. φ’. 108,
where however we may suppose an ellipsis of τούτων before ὅν, and that
one of those changes from the plural to the singular, so common in Greek,
takes place. See also Prom. Vinct. 777, and § 70.

(b) Cottocott'on or mere accumulatiora os relative sonna. This hap-
pens, (1) commonly with quisque in the sense of ‘each,' which is
not a relative pronoun, but the distributive adjective 3 as, quantum
baroncellis: quantum quisque poscit, ibid: quantum cuique σοα-
fidas, ibid: quoeab quoque traduntur, Caes. (2) where different rela-
tionships of case or mode are to be expressed, as in English:
‘whither, and from whom, and for what ς’ or in Greek, ἃ δ’ ἀφ’ ἧς
ἡμέρας, Πεια. de Cor. aa, or in the following, supremis· antem genere
quid et quantum, et quamobrem postuletur, et qao, et
quanto queque res premio digna eit, considerabitur, Cic. de
Inven. ii. 39: quibua c'a omnam, quid tempora petant, ant
quid personis dignam sit, considerandam est, et noc qnid, sed
qao quidque animo, quicum, quo tempore, quamdiu flat
attendendum est, ibid. ii. 58, illustrating both this and the pre·
ceding: (3) where one of the relatives is really only a substitute
for the demonstrative and copula3 as, qutjucenet quantos ostea-
tont aspice circa, Virg. AEn. vi. 771, ‘and behold how great strength
those youths exhibit,' or, as iu the following parenthesis ; et, quo
quid αὶίανίνσ privato timentum foret, in vicmto ettam duct passast,
Liv. iv. 26, where, to avoid the collision os et, et, let us supply cam
co for qna, which accurately represents the construction: (4) where
one of the relatives stands for something else, as it does in some
instances 3 thus, que rotet quoa armare, Ter. Heaut. ii. 3, 122,
in which example quos stands sor quotes, in the usage already
explained, where it is put for tolet.- (5) where one of the forms is
interrogative, and the other relative; as, quis est qui, and its
inflexionsz and again, (6) where one is used sarcastically, as, bem t
quo frctus sam qut mc trodte ea tranquillissimo re conjecisti in
nuptias, Ter. Andr. iii. 5, 133 in this instance, qui having the force
of quatis, ‘what a pretty sort of fellow I have relied on.'

Oba. l. Sometimes, by a redundant repetition, we have a double
relative in the same reference3 as, alr γὰρ ἠράσθη τυχεῖν ἐκτήσαθ’ αὑτῷ
θάνατον ὅνπερ ἤθελεν, Soph. Aj. 940, where we have civ ἠράσθη
τυχεῖν having reference to θάνατον, which is again redundantly qualified
by ὅνπερ ἤθελεν, of precisely parallel signification.

2. In a few instances the relative aad demonstrative clauses are not
distinguished by a different form, in which case two relatives will appear
to be found in connexion. Thus St. Paul, 1 Cor. ii. 9, ἃ ὀφθαλμὸς obs·
εἶδε, καὶ οὖς οὐκ ἢκουσε, καὶ ἐπὶ καρδίαν ἀνθρώπου οὒκ ἀνέβη, d ἡτοίμασεν
ὃ θεὸς τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν abror: but this may be explained by leaving out
either the first or the last, and translating either ‘what eye hath not seen
