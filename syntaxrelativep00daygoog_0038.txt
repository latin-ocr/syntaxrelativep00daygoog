affected3 as, qaae para ciuitatis Helvetia inciperem calamitatem

lation, ‘that was the party which chiefly suffered retribution'

Oba. What is called the use of the article for the relative prououn in
Homer, is nothing more than thia use of the direct construction. If. we
take the common example, τὸν βάλε δεξιὸν ὦμον, and analyse it, we have
a verb which would take, in the ordinary way, either an accusative of the
person or of the thing separately, used with both coincidently3 and τόν
may either be what we call the relative or the personal pronoun. The
sarrpp paslage’limledgr’ often ooeurs with μίν, as ll. ε’. 188. λ’. 583 3 and
wrt κατα, as .ε. .

Ιιι Homer's time, it is probable that the article, pronoun personal,
demonstrative, and relative, were much confused, or were merely variatione
of a common form or forma, of which the uses were not always very
broadly or precisely distinguished. Take as a specimen, ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν
πολίων ἐξεπράθομεν, τὰ δέδασται, Hom. Il. α’. 125, where the first ra' has
the force of d, and the second of ταῦτα. Again‚ we have τάπερ for ἅπερ,
aa τότε στυγέουσι θεοί περ, Il. v'. 65. This use of article, as relative, is
common enough in the Attio tragedians; though, from the introduction oi
a point before many of the cases, they are rather regarded by the editors
as cases of the direct plausa: thus, τόν, d πυρφόρων ἆστραπᾶν κράτη
:settenguenterta 2222122222ιῇ 2
καλλίσταν ὁ χρυσοφαὴς ’Ἅλιος αὒγάζει, Eurip. Hecub. 629. A firrther
evidence of this confusion in Homer may be inferred from another practice
not uncommon with him. When he has commenced with a relative

and there are besides cases in which ὅς is better translated by ‘and he τ’
aa, ὃς τίκτε θεανὼ καλλιπάρῃον, Hom. ll. λ’. 224: lic ῥα τότ’ ’Arpeldear
Ἀγαμέμνονος ἀντίος ἦλθεν, ibid. 231. See Trollope, also Il. ρ’. 198, and
Theogn. 205, quoted by him. l have already notieed above, adouble use
of the relative, where the last has merely the force of the copula, ll. ε’.
404. Again, as already shown, the construction began by the relative, is
osten terminated by the personal pronoun; as, ὃς μέγα πάντων Ἀργείων
κρατέει eal ol πείθονται Ἀχαιοί, Il. α’. 78. Justas ὅς is followed by ῥιί, .
sois rdv: thus, τόν ῥά ποτ’ αὐτὸς, ll. φ’. 35, so also ll. β’. 21. 309. 742.
C. 402, and other places, which an index will supply. This ῥά is a
common appendege of the relative ὅς, just as dp of the interrogative ; as,
τίς τ’ ἄρ σφωε θεῶν, Il. α’. 8. To the proof of the original oneness of

these forms may be added the Attia use of ὅς, which maintained its place

in later times, in the well-known phrases so frequent in Plato, ἦ ὅς,
ἦ δ’ ἤ, and in the expressions, καὶ ὃς γελάσας ἔφη, Protag. 310, D: καὶ ὃς
εἶπεν ἐρυθριάσας, ibid. 312, A, and elsewhere. ln the later Greek writers,
it is curious that the relative forms ὃς μέν, ὃς δέ, usurped the place of the
demonstrativas ὁ μέν, ὁ δέ. This is supposed not to have got into use in
the time of Demosthenes, though it is found in two psephismata in the

Crown Oration, and in some readings in the text, ᾗ 71. See Bremi¹s note
