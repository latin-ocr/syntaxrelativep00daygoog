uideor esse quem tam opertesolhere incipias dolis„ ibid. Andr.
iii. 2‚13= cdeon' videamus cobis esse idonei in quibus sic
illudatis, ibid. Andr. iv. 4, 19: Pompeias idoneus non qui
impetret, Cic. pro leg. Manil. 19. 57.

j 89.—So also after is put for totis, or after tom; as neque enim
toises, qui, quisisnescios‚ Cic. ad Divers.v.12: se enimcum
esse dicit qui coperet non qui eapupnuret, Nep. Ages. 5. In
Greek, the indicative is used in the same circumstances ; as, οὐκ
ἔστιν οὕτω μῶρος, ὃς θανεῖν ἐρᾷ, Soph. Antig. 220, ‘no one is so
foolish as to desire to die τ’ nic οὖν οὕτως ἐστὶ δυστυχὴς ὅστις
βουλήσεται; Dem. de Class. d‘: but with the optative in the fol-
lowing, οὖδεὶς οὕτως ἠλίθιός ἔστιν ὅστις οὐχ ἱκανὸν δοίη, ibid. η’,
and in examples quoted above.

Obs. This rule is of some extent, and comprehende a variety of cases,
where the force of the English ‘that,' or ‘such that,' may be detected.
On the other hand, is, put for talis, is sometimes followed by the relative
and indicative, where the force of the English ‘as’ is intended to be con·
veyed3 as, itaque epo is in illum sum qoem tu me esse ois, Cic. Attio.
vii. ep. 83 and so in the following, where it has a causal force, heu me

miseram qai taam animum ec animo spectatricem, Ter. Andr. iv.
1, 22.

§so-The subjunctive is used aster comparativae with wem
qai, in all its cases or inflexions3 as, major sum quam cui
possit fortuna nocue, Ovid, Met. vi. 195.

Obs. This, like its predecessore, comes under the more general rule of
the relative clause being essential to the sense of the proposition. To say
‘I arn too great’ would be umneaning3 but the proposition becomes
complete when it is added, ‘to be hurt by fortune!

§ot-Qut albei· quippe is followed usually by the subjunctive,
though we then render the passage by ut, in the sense of ‘ as that ε’
as, nihil attinet eom ec teye considerare, qui p pc quc in hya
scripta non sit, Cic. de Invent. ii. 45.

Obs. The expressions quippe cum, quippe ubi, quippe ut, are employed
in the same way. Plautus, however, uses an indicative in similar cases,
and Sallust occasionally does so too; as, qui p pe coi omnes copiae in
usu quotidiano, et cultu corporis eran t, Cat. 48. Again, with at qui we
have the indicative or subjunctive, according to the sense3 thus, ut
quibus esset persuasum, Caes. B. G. v. 31: ut apud quos plurimum
biems occupat, Tac. Germ. 22, where the first contains a plea why, the
second a fact that. ln the oblique oration, quippe, like some other words
named above, is put with the accusative and infinitive3 as, quippe duos
pro uno domino acceptos, Liv. iii. 9. In Greek, we render the quippe qai

of the Latins by the dative of the participle3 as, καλῶς ἔλεξεν cit-cilon- „

μένῳ πεσεῖν, Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 597.
