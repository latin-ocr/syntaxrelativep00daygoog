with the forms having sn initis] q or c, as may be seen by their compouuds
alicubi, alicunde, necubi, necunde, necuter, sicubi, sud the Greek κόπρος :
for the student is cautioncd against supposing that the composition of
these words is from nec ubi, sicubi. By the subjoined passages, dispositis
exploratoribus necubi effecto ponte Romani copias transducerent, Caes.
B. G. vii. 35, ‘that the Romans might not any where throw over their
forces ι’ 3 ecu bi consistere coactis necessaria od usus deessent, primos ire
jussit, Liv. xxii. 2: et circumspectans necu n d e impetus in frumentatores
fieret, ibid. 23, it will be seen that this is not the case. Probably ubi or
cubi is thus an old dative, out of which 3 writer in the Journal of Edu-
cation, vol. ii. 357, supposes the French ou, y to have sprung. This
is rendered further probable by its relation to the Greek οὗ, 333 this
would rather tend to show that ubi is an old genitive. lt would be
allowable enough to consider that ubi is an old form of cui, taking the
digamma from between u and i, and putting it as q at the commcnoement.
It is, however, possible to carry this theory of inflexion too far. Thus,

huc and illuc might pass for datives or accusatives, buticino, illinc appear ·

to have no relation in form to ablatives; and we are, therefore, rather led
to imagine, that a simple convenient mark, to distinguish the direction of
motion, might be resorted to, not founded on the usual method of inflexion.
And thus too in unde, eunde, which are so manifestly identical in sense
and construction with de quo, we carmot understand how un stands for an
ablativa, excepting on the supposition that it was a sort of fixed form, put
to represent the relative in componnd words, as unquam, unde. Whether
inde and ibi are related to bic, in the same way that unde, ubi, are related
to qui, is perhaps hardly clear, and it is possible that the former are
formed merely on the analogy of the latter. Be this as it may, they are
related to each otherus demonstrative and relative forms in their present
adverbial use. The etymology of quin, from its use atter verbs of doubting,
is manifestly qui non, and we need not stay to illustrate this⁸. The
etymology and uses of the Latin ne are derived from the Greek μή, and it
is easy to see how 3 negative particle, adapted to the use of objectiva or
dependent clauses, should corne to enjoy the powers of 3 conjunction,
while its presence would 33 3333 indicate the connexion with 3 preceding
verb. Hence it is used in prohibitione without any preceding verb, though
the general use of the subjunctive mood in this case shows that the idea
of ellipsis may 33 properly resorted to, and the use of the imperative, 33
in the following, onyce 33 parce muliynus urenoe, Hor. od. i. 28, 23, is
not at variante with this view of the case, for we have seen elsewhere,
Aecus. 3ηά Infin. p. 34, that oro is thus actually used when there is no
negation3 as, 0 regino, orantus te prohibe, vegetantes, 333
oramus here being used parenthetically3 and thus verbs themselves, like
licet and the Greek ὤφελον, may come to be used adverbially3 or like
crede, and oremus in the above passage, or precor, are in process of trans-
formation, judging by the construction. Utrum, used as a conjunction, is
the neuter of the relative form uter, while un and ne, used as conjunc-

ὅ13 Terence wc meet with the original construction, only with the
indicative3 as, sed epo nunc milvi cesso qui non humerum bunc onero
pullio, Phorm. v. 6, 4: and thus qui, for ut qui, is used with indicative,
ibid. iii. l, 7, qui abieris.
