stitute for quae, is evidently of the same class as the example before it,
and the demonstrative pronoun is sometimes used in a similar way3 as,
linc illae lacrymae, laee tua ’st misericordie, Ter. And. i. 1, 99, where
lraec has much the force of the preceding ltine. In other cases, where
some editors put the pronominal form, rather than the adverbial, there is
ground for questioning the propriety of this. Mr. Stewart, in his edition
of Cornelius NepoS, edits, post annum quintum que expulsus erat, in
Cim. 3, where the idiom of the language requires quam, in which Ι hold
the same opinion as the Reviewer, Journal of Eduaiii. 124. For although
the separation of postquam, priusquam, by what Grammarians call tmesis,
is perhaps a mere fancy, they having been originally distinct, and therefore
the relative in all probability declined‚ there can be little doubt but that the
relative had assumed the adverbial form, or rather a constant form, prior to
the use of the compound adverb, as is proved by its perpetual occurrence in
‚ the separate state3 and it is still further probable that this would be the
case, in regard to such ordinary and familiar references as those of time,
place, and quantity. Supposing the etymology of postquem, antequam,
plusquam, to be thus ascertained, we should find no difficulty in under-
standing how the form quem might itself come to be significant of time,
place, and quantity, as in the words nunquam, ‘no time,’ ‘neven’ nusquam,
‘no place,’ ‘no where,’ and the use osquam aster comparativae, which
always contain the notion of quantity. There are of course many adverbs,
in which the declinable forms are wholly preserved, or partially so, asin
quo paeto, quo numero, quo modo, quemadmodum, quamobrem, quoad, quo-

office as conjunctione, in connecting these cladses with the verb in the
leading proposition, where we should not, it is true, substitute an adverb,
but where the analogy is obvious. A remarkable instance of this was
quoted by me above, καὶ ὁ Ἀστυάγης ἰδὼν ἐθαύμασε (not dm, rt. r. h.. but)
τί νος treberi σα ντ ος ἥκοι, Xenoph. (lyr. i. 14. Ι may ltere mention
likewise a use of ὅστις ob for ὥστε μή, occurring Xen. Anab. ii. 5, 12.

5. The adverb is osten put where we might substitute a pronoun in its
place. Thus, ἀραῖος ὡς ἠράσατο, Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 1267, for αἷς ἀραῖς.
Again, τὸν αὑτὸν τρόπον ὥσπερ, for ὅνπερ. Deru. Philipp. A. ιδ’. καὶ σοὶ
θεοὶ πόροιεν, ὡς ἐγὼ θέλω, for ola, Soph. OEdip. Col. 1119, where Wun-
der notes, that learned men, through want of attention to the practice of
Greek writers, especially that of the poets, who commonly use ὡς for dea..
d, or the like, have indulged the vainest conjectures. ln Terence, Adelph.
iii. 3, 81, we have quamobrem for propter quem; as, quando is quom-
obrem aenerum: multa concurrunt simul qui conjecturam boae auae

² We may see how thoroughly a compound like this may become
adverbial, in such apassage as the following: multae res eam horta·
bantur quare, Caes. B. C. i. 33, where the construction, not regarding

quare as an adverb, is multoe res que re. Some writers deduce eur from
cui rei, as it is used rather more widely than quere, which expects an
answer, but eur does not necessarily. With regard to quoad, there is no

difficulty whatever in supposing that the d of the quod is absorbed. In
· the matres of Terence, this echthlipsis of dat the end of a word before an
initial vowel in the next is well known with quid, sed, dyc.
