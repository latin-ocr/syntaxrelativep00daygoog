frapatio borum ualuit quin preferrent, Liv. iv. 44: numquid uis quia
abeam? Ter. Adelph. ii. 2, 39. The Greek μή οὐ has often the
force of quin, with this difference, that it may be followed bya
participle, while quin requires the subjunctive. Hence it follows
any word of negation or deficiency3 as, ἥκεις γὰρ ob κενή γε,
τοῦτ’ ἐγὼ σαφῶς ἔξοιδα, μὴ οὐχὶ δεῖμ’ ἐμοὶ φέρουσά τι, Soph.
OEdip. Col. 355, ‘it cannot be but that you are come bringing
some terror to me? The following will illustrate theuso of quod
the conjunctione bic quum ob Apuanide aculeatus esset, quod
Piraum Nicanori prodidisset, Nep. in Phoc. 3: et ante omues
Q. SeruilioPrisco, quod uon depenerasset ab stirpe Claudia,
collaudante juvenem, Liv. iv. 48: admirabatur quod Titum filium
abdominibus relepasset et ruri babitare jussisset, Cic. de
Off. iii. 31: questum quodpopularentur, Caes. B. G. i. 37.
Thus, too, aster an equivalent to a verb of accusation3 as, qui
M. Postumio et Τ. Quinctio diem diruant quod pupnatum
esset, Liv. iv. 40. And likewise after a substantive implyinga
sentiment3 as, tumen illo dolore, quod Roma non sis animum tuum
libera, Cic. Ep. ad Divers. vi. l. With the expressions capomatius,
babeo pretias, we very commonly meet with an indicative after
quod, the proposition in these cases being complete and true in
itself without the causal.

Obs. l. The subjunctive or indicative is used, according as the relative
clause is essential to the complete sense or not, or according as the writer
intends the relative clause to contain amere explanation of the cause or
the terms of the praise, blame, accusation, or complains. The examples
quoted with the subjunctive will fall under the general rule of objectiva
relative clauses, or the more special rules‚ j 80, § 81, and § 84.

2. Quod, in the oratio obliqua, is sometimes followed hyan accusative
and infinitive3 as, quod si quid ei a Caesare pravius accidisset, nemi-
nem existimaturum, Caes. B. G. i. 20. ThisIhaveattemptedto
explain above, j 38. In the sense of ‘as to that,’ it is not put with the
subjunctive, unless one of Δ the special rules applies to the case3 as, quod
me ad consuetudinem revocas, fuit mcum quidem jampridem rempublicam
lupera, Cic. Ep. ad Attic· xii. 28.

3. There is another class of instances in which quod, ‘that,’ takes the
subjunctive, which belong to the special rule immediately following, but
must be noticed here for the sake of systematis arrangement. This takes

η place when quad and its clause follows a verb in the subjunctive moad, as
one of the particulare included in the subject of that verb, or rather,
perhaps, where the relative clause is isself the subject of the verb, though
au apposition word, implying the subsequent clause, is expressed with
the previous verb. Thus, quum ad bas suspiciones certissimae res
accederent; qp o d per fiaes Sequanorum Heluetios trau sd unisset;
