relative clause to which it is prefixed3 but, in order to connect
itself more closely with some preceding noun, it has changed its
place, and also its form, from demonstrative to relative.

Obs. l. In fact it is doubtful, whether it cau be said to have charged
its place at all; for Cornelius Nepos, with whom this usage is of perpetual
occurrence, uses the demonstrative pronoun in the same way nearly as
frequently; thus, is quum talem conditionem aspernaretur Elpi-
aice aeqaait, Cim. 1: uictor ex Asia quum reverteretur eam
pervertere concupiuit, Lys. 2: id quum apportaretur priusquam
classis eairet accedit ut, Alcib. 3. And so in other writers3 nam is
postquam excessit ea ephebis Sosia liberius uiuendi fuit potestas,
Ter. Andr. i. 1, 24, where ei implied is put as nominative to excessit, in
the shape of is. Hannibal nec temere eredendo, benique quum
respondisset, dc. Liv. xxi. 34: brec sicut auditu erant, rea M.
AEmilio perscribit, ibid. xxi. 49. In the following, eqo is likewise put
before the relative, though the subject of the verb in the relative clause 3
lma eqo quum audissem, ibid. iv. 20. And again, where the relative is
objectiva to the verb in the relative clause, it is sometimes put first3 as,
quid ut a uobis sperent, ‘that they may hope for what,‘ ibid. iv. 49.
The subjoined passage, e qo cui daturus nou sum, ut ei despondeum?
Ter. Heaut. iv. 5, 36, is an expression of surprise, ‘I to promise her tobim
when Ι have no such intentioul' where l do not translate ut by ‘how,’ nor
put the interrogation. Again, eqou’ meu bona ut dem Bacchidi dono
scieas, ibid. v. 5, 6. This is done also in another way, for the sake of
emphasis, orjust as the Greeks put a word er structura at the outset of a
sentence3 as, eos aero qui ... ut commendatos vobis lubeatis pe-
tendum videtur, Cic. ad Divers. x. Ep. 8. 148: ros . . . quo tandem auimo

essedebetis,Cic.proleg.Manil5.ll: pratus quod seassimulat ’

laetum id dicis? Ter. Heaut. v. 1, 15: ille ut item contra me ba b eat,
facio sedulo, ibid. Adelph. i. 1, 25: postremo alii clanculum Patres,
quae faciunt, ea ue me celet, consuefeci filium, ibid. i. 1, 27, where
also eu, the objectos the ae clause, is praeposed, just as baec in the fol·
lowing3 baec si aeque eqo, aeque tu fecimus, ibid. i. 2, 23: AEsabiaus
ubi est, ibid. ii. 3, 7: is, quod mihi, dc. ibid. iii. 4, 54.

2. Thus, in a general way, it stands at the begimring of a distinct
period, by which circumstance it is osten distinguishable, and is of the
same class with other instances‚ such as the initial quod, quare. In short,
we may state the rule differently, and say, ‘Tuas wununvra run

rua suarncr os a ursorunmcaa ou coun1r10uan canusa couwrcrnn

3. But it does not always stand at the beginning of a sentence, though
its use with an immediate antecedent, in this way, is much more rare, aud
perhaps only in the oblique oration, though the case now to be quoted
differs from those brought forward below3 as, nou illud consulare impe-

referred to the verbs following qui and quia,· while in other instances the
relative, being in the nominative, may be the subjectos a fresh verb, and
we are led to anticipata such a verb accordingly.
