signification it is copied 110111 a Greek idiota. Thus, in the passages, ut

part 01 10111001 these adverbial 1011111, tending clearly to show their origin,
as in καθάπερ, διότι, quamobrem: and we 011011 lind the two separate, as it
were in process 01 0111111011, as in the following: ἐν bap τοῦτο μέλ-

lerhe pronoun is put 011011 where we might supply its place by the
adverb. Thus, b'a’ ἐπεικάσαι, Soph.(Edip.col.150‚ 101· aa: ut uerna
tam humilis esset cui (ut) 101 aditus pateret, Nep. in Milt. 7: 1111111111
uuquam tam impudentem fuisse qui, 10. cic. pro leg. Manil. 16. 48:
acmo erit tam injustus qui, ibid. pro M. Marcell. 5. 15. In all
these examples we may notice, however, the prevailing idiom, 10110 est
tam qui, in which the Latine used the pronoun, and not the adverb as in
English. But qui is used aster tara in other ways3 uum qui aute te tam
aesariu' qui 111 facerent. This usage may be explained either by ellipsis
or attraction 3 011 the latter supposition, the relative being attracted to the

rincipal subject, rather than corresponding to the adverbial qualification.
The same may be said 01 the following: au acro ullam usquam 0110011111
ta m desertam putatis quo 101 fama pervaserit. Cic. pro leg. Manil. 15.

neuter pronoun, somewhat analogous to that 01 ὅ 101 ὅτι in Hom. Il. 1131.
τ’. 421. χ’. 445. Od. λ’. 539, mentioned above. The passage which
Ι 10101 to occurs Rom. vi. 10, ὃ γὰρ ἀπέθανε-ὃ δὲ ζῇ, ‘in that he
died: ‘in that he liveth.’ This is, however, probably nothing more than
the Latin use 01 quod for quod ablactari: soritis worthy 01 remark that
St. Paul elsewhere, Rom. v. 8, uses ὅτι with the meaning 01 ‘in that.’
We find sometimes in poetry, by a species of hypallage, the declinable
form 01 the pronoun rather than the adverbial. Thus, 111 the annexed‚ qui
has rather the force 01 quomodo, qua ratioue, than any thing 011ος quo
uiuat 1110111111 matu, 1111111101 quae 11110 recursus nutriat Oceano, quo

Claudian de Fl. Mall. Theod. Consul. 102-110, 101 ⁶ how it is the moon
does so‚’ ‘what is the nature 01 that flama which leaves red trains 01 light:
‘how is it that the wind causes the thunder to burst.’ Thus, too, in the
passage of Virgil, quo rualem 11110 immanis equi statuere? quis auctor?
011110101111101111011910,1111111110 1101111111 belli? AEn. ii.

purpose.' This passage, though perhaps not admitting an adverbial sub-
