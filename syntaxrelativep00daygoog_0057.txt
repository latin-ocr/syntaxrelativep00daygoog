besides, cum εοτίἰιοι et aliquid oyes eorum qaorum remusati, Cic.
raptim quitur quisque poterat elatis ceilam ¹, Liv., for qua in
each case. Hunter here incorrectly punctuates before elatis. ln
all these Latin examples there is, however, nothing decisive of the
practice3 for in every instance the verb that really governs is un-
expressed, which serves to render the practice admissible. ⁸ Thus,
in the first, we may supply a quocum aarum dirimam in the
second, ᾳιιὶὸιιι poterat is akind of compound relative like quiden-
libem in the third, quibas vellet'may be similarly regarded, or frui
understood3 in the fourth, we may supply capas penem eas fatere
demonstravimus ,· in the fifth and sixth, again consterno and possam
are neither of them the complete verb, but only express a mood of
that which is suppresscd. Idistinguish these cases of attraction
from those in which no antecedent is expressed‚ and iu which the
relative takes the case in which the antecedent would be, were it
present. Thus, ἐδήλωσε δὲ τοῦτο οἷς τῇ ὑστεραίᾳ ἔπραττε, Xen.
Anab. ii. 2, 18: οὐκ ἄξιον εἰπεῖν ὅ γ ε pud ἐς πεῖρον ’ἔδωκε θεῶν τινὸς
εὔνοια, Dem. Cor. vK': φρονεῖν ἔοικας οὐδὲν ὤν ἐγὼ λέγω, Soph.
Electr. 1031: οὐδὲν ὧν λέγουσι, Plat. Men. 99, C: ὃς φόβῳ
φυγιῖιν ὧν εἶδε, OEdip. Tyr. 1182 real p’o‘ Φοῖβος ὧν μὲν ἱκόμην
ἄτιμον ὶὲἐπεμψεν, ibid. 7612 δυνατοὶ χρῆσθαι olc ἐκεῖνοι εἰργά-
σαντο, Plat. Euthyd. 289, D.; aud thus continually with the ex-
pressions οὐδὲν ὧν, ἐφ’ οἶς. There are other passages in Latin,
where the readings differ3 as, notante judae, qao nosti, populo,
Hor. Sati. 6, 15, where some editors read quem.

Otr. Among the Greek writers, the practice of conforming the relative
to the case of the antecedent is cf such frequent occurrence, that it is
difficult to say which was the rule and which the exception3 and certainly,
when the antecedent itself was not expressed‚ they appear commonly to
have taken the relative as its substitute, even to the form of construction ¹.
If therefore we continue to regard the instances in which the demon-
strative and relative both occur in the same case, as instaures of attraction,
we ought not to continue to do so, therefore, when the antecedent is
wanting. While the Greek use of the relative corresponds‚ in the main,
with that of the Latin, there is still a manifest difference3 for with the
Greeks, the relative clause was more fully an objective one than with the
Latins. Τὴυε, ὦν διαμάρτοιεν, καὶ μὴ μετάσχοιεν ὧν ὑμεῖς οἶ τὰ βέλ·
τιστιι βουλόμενοι τοὺς θεοὺς αἰτεῖτε, μηδὲ μεταδοῖεν ὑμῖν ὦν οὗτοὶ προ·
ᾕρηνται, Dem. deCor. εἴ. Here ὧν, in the two instances marked, is

¹ It is of little consequence whether we term this attraction, or whether,
as in Greek, we treat the relative as susceptihle of the demonstrative con·
struction.

² This attraction is even exhibited in the adverbial uses; as, κεῖθεν
ὅθενπερ ἥκει, Soph.·OEdip. Col. 1222, for κεῖσε.
