it is a particle of ‘ similitude' or ‘time 3' but when it signifies
‘that,’ ‘in order that: it marks an objective proposition. 'l'he
adverb qaam, or cam, very often relates to time, and takes the sub-
junctive too, but the use of the subjunctive in such cases marka
that it is necessary to the sense of the proposition3 as, qaam dac

Liv. ii. 51. Here the object of the writer is not to specify the time
when these parties were consuls, but, on the contrary, to note the
time when the overthrow took place, and the historical connexion.

d 101.-1n Greek, the peculiar power and use os the participle
enables us to dispensa with the nse of the relative in many cases,
where in Latin we have no other alternative.

§loa-ln conclusion, it may be observed, that there will of
course be found occasional deviatione from fixed rule, where no
very satisfactory reason can be assigned for the use of one mood in
preference to another. Sometimes theone, and sometimes the
other will be proper, according as the writer wishes more to insist
on the fact itself, than another person's adducing that fact3 that is
to say, the relative clause may contain the sentimenta of another,
and be at the same time a fact of the writers knowledge, and it
may be presented either as the one or the other3 as in the fol·

writer, where our own language more commonly uses an indicative.
There is considerable difficulty, moreover, in classifying examples,
while it osten happens that the same instance may be ranged under

two or three special rules, all containing particular cases of a
general principle, but which it is nevertheless important to pre-
serve and set sarth, from fear of falling into too great generality,
in which there is some danger of the young student's not being
able to follow out the rule prescribed to him.
