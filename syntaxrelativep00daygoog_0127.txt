object, but only a predicate atter thcm; to. which Ireply, that if
the term objective is regarded as inapplicable, our rule must be
enlarged. But the same analogy holds as in·the case of objective
clauses properly so called. In these last, if the relative clause is
only explanatory of the elliptical object, we use an indicative3 isit
constitutes the object itsell', then the subjunctive; and so with
predicate clauses, if the relative clause only explains an elliptical-
predicate, we employ the indicative, if it is itself the whole pre-
dicate, then the subjunctive. Even many apparently subjective
relative clauses have the verb in the subjunctive, when the
whole clause constitutas the subject, and is nota mere explanation
of an omitted subject. of this description are the following:
quid ec postulet pervidendum, Cib. de Fin. v. 162 deinceps

Ι uidendum est puoe sit lerninis ustura, ibid v. 12: quid sit

primm est uidendum, Tusc. (luaest. i. 9. Now in all these, the
relative clause appears to take the place of the-subject, and yet the
subjunctive is found in thern, as 'uniformly as if the clause occu-
· pied the objective positipn. There are two methods of reconciling
this apparent difficulty with the general principle. 'lh'e first, by
showing that the Latins, in other impersonal usages, did hold the
impersonal to he the governing word, althpugh the word or sen-
tence so governed might be made the subject of the impersonal 3
and the second, by showing that the subjupctive, in these cases,

has originated under circumstances in which' the clause was objec- .

tive, if the first argument be disputed. Thus we say in Latin,
fruendum est douo, utendum est opere, rather than bouum cstfiueu-
dum, opus est utendum5 and the Greek verbal impersonal governs
its noun likewise3 aa, πολλὴν δὴ τὴν μετάστασιν καὶ μεγάλην δεικ-
τέον, Demosth. Olynth. A. s': ἢ μηδένα ἄλλον αἶτιαιτέον, ibid.
Philipp. Δ. ιη’, which appears conclusive as to the question, while
on the other hand, if this be regarded as insufficient evidence,
we have only to show that it would he correct to say, quid eo
postulet pervidere, uidere quc sit hominis ustura, in the active con-
struction, analogy teaching us, that in a change from the active to
the passive structure, the whole object of the active becomes the
subject of the passive3 . and if that object is a sentence, its gender
will be regarded as neuter, or, in other words, the changed con-
struction will be impersonal. The subjunctive, for the same
reason, is used in relative clauses, after any other impersonal,
, whose personal use implies an object3 as, uon minori cure est
quotis respublica sutura sit, Cic. de Amic. 12. 43. ·· But, in order to·
see the necessity of this use of the subjunctive still further, lmay
observe, that it is manifestly necessary to the sense. Thus, suut
