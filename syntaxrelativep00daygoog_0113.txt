the ‘I,' the subject of this condition, and the rest of men included in
ἀνδρῶν. In a certain sense, therefore, the genitive may here be said to

’ depend on ἐγὼ, though itis the intervention of the superlative adverb

which determines the relation between ἐγὼ and ἀνδρῶν.

§sa-The relative sometimes agrees with an implied ante-
cedent, as in the case quoted elsewhere, θρόκιος ἱππότης ἵν’ ὁ

γέρων πατὴρ ἔθετό νιν, Eurip. Hecub. 697, where lua has reference ·

, to the country, Thrace, implied in the adjective. This is commonly
the case aster the possessive adjective pronouns3 as, μονομάτορος
ὀδυρμοῖς ἒ μοῖς ἃ, Ρὴωηίευ. 15173 δεῖξον σδν αἶιῖινα με’λεον ὃς,
ibid. 1532, where the editors punctuate a semicolon before the
relative, which is done constantly elsewhere, as Pboeniss. 662, and
so before ἔνθεν, ἔνθα, 657, 6703 but the Greek· bas little more
than the force of our comma. so τῆς ἐμῆς ἐπεισόδου ὃν μήτ’
ὀκνεῖτε μήτ’ ἀφῆτ’, Soph. OEdip. Col. ⁷27: nostro tamea qui
remansissemus cede, Cic. Cat. i. 3: isto decent humeros postumius
nostros qai dare patrumm qui modo stravimus, Ovid,
Met. i. 467. Precisely analogous toahis is the use of the parti·
ciple in lieu of the relative 3 aa, ἐμοῖσιν ὄσσοις ὀμίχλα προσῇξε
σὸν δέμας ε ἶ σ ι δ ο i σρ, AEsch. Prom. Vinct. 148.

b tra-ln addition to not agreeing with the last-named subject,
as before mentioned, the relative occasionally changes the person.
ThuS, πρὸς τόνδε δ’ εἶμι, καὶ λόγους ιἰμεόψομαι, δς φῇ ς, Eurip
Hecub. 11722 ἃ τὸν τοῦδ’ οὔποτ’ εὐφρανεῖ βίον· ὅς γ’ ιδ
κάκιστε, σκῆπτρα καὶ θρόνους ἔχων, ἃ νῦν ὁ σδς ξύναιμος ἐν
θὴβαις ἔχει, τὸν αὐτὸς αὑτοῦ πατέρα τόνδ’ ιἰπήλασας, Soph.
OEdip. Col. 1348, where both change of person and non-agreement
with the last subject may be noted. But it may be remarked here,
that the change of person is really only imaginary, for the first
τοῦδε, as well as the last τόνδε, are used δεικτικῶς, a common
practice in a personal address, and hence the relative has its person

⁰ determined by the sense, which in actual dialogus could not give

rise to misapprehension.

§on-The freedom of Greek construction osten allows the
sense, and not the exact words, to determine the agreement, in
other cases. Thus, ὅτῳγὰρ ὤφθην εὐτυχοῦσ’, αἰδώς μ’ ἔχει,
ἐν τῷδε πότμῳ τυγχάνονσ’, ἵν’ εἰμὶ νῦν, Eurip. Hecub. 949,
where see Pflugk’s note to his edition, verse 970, and parallel
passages there quoted. ln this example, τνγχόνονσα is conformed
to αἰδοῦμαι, implied in αἰδώς μ’ ἔχει, while ellipsis takes place, the
sense being ‘ for I am ashamed to be see n in adversity‚ in the ἦ
condition at present allotted me, by those by whom Ι was seen
in prosperity.' And thus in other cases the relative has reference
