oblique to the direct structure without notice. Matthiae, in his
Grammar, has given many examples of this, see q 529, Oba. 5, ’
of his third edition, and explains the well-known practice of
introducing the ὅτι before the ι’μεὶιιίινο verbo of the speaker, in
this way. 'l'hus the indicative is found very frequently in the

oratio obliquo, where the optative would be expected, and often
after ὅτι the indicative is interchanged with the optative in the
same passages. Thus, ἔλεγε δὴ, ὡς ἦλθε ἀρχὴν ὁΣόλων-καὶ
θεησάμενος πάντα τὸν ἑωυτοῦ ὄλβον ἀποφλαυρίσειε, Herod.
i.86: λέγων ὡςέπιῤῥέονσι οἶ Ἕλληνες καὶ ἀπολάμψοιτο
συχνούς, ibid. ix. 38. In a similar way, after ὅτι, in the sense of
‘because 3' ἆῤῥώδεον, ὅτι αὐτοὶ μὲν ἐν Σαλαμῖνι κατήμενοι ὑπὲρ γῆς
τῆς Ἀθηναίων ναυμαχέειν μέλλοιεν, νικηθέντες δὲ ἐν νήσῳ ἆπο·
λαμφθέντες πολιορκήσονται, ibid. viii. 70, where Matthiae
supposes that the indicative marks a determinate and real fact that
would arise, the optative one that would probably arise3 though
this is not necessary, if the freedom above spoken of is conceded.

§ra-An interrogative sentence is not regarded as objective
when the direct interrogation takes place. Though, from the
previous analysis there seems reason to suppose, that the relative
pronoun has gained its interrogative force from its use aster such
verbs as posco, τομο, peto, quero, in a dependent clause. rhe
syntax, however, does not bear testimony in favour of such a view.
Thus, qua aero promulgata illo anno fuerunt? quc promisso multis?
⁸5⁰· cic. pro Sext. 30. 66: quid dicum? qui locus orbis terre jum
non erat alicui destinatos, ibid. We have seen, moreover, already,
that the interrogative quis, and the various interrogative adverbial
forms, are in the oblique oration construed with an accusative and
infinitive, particularly where rhetorical indignation is conveyed,
so that the interrogative appears to follow its own laws. A
good illustration is contained in the following: Sr. Quid est?
Crnswno. Quid ait? Ter. Adelph. ii. 3, 8, where the real direct
question has the indicative, the repeated question, depending on
royo understood, bas the subjunctive expressed. Of interrogative
uses in the oratio obliquo with the infinitive, I may quote quid
mirum out imsuper-acue esse? Liv. xxi. 30: quid periculi, quid
‘latmia εειήανιίνιο esse, ibid: quicquam videri, ibid: quid agitur?
quid oqoturWPerent. Adelph. iii. 3, 19.

(a) lt is somewhat curicus, that where, to a considerable extent, the
whole sense of a passage depende upon whether we use the subjunctive or
