58 ουιιιι οιιιιιιι nonnas wrru ιι nouu[cn.v1.

tiveclause,we haveat quauta superioressimas, taat oaosyero-
mas summissius, Cic. ΟΕ ι. 26, and so with all other relative

clauses. Tales ιι hhewrse followed by aa and atquc Tam also stands
as ansvering to quir as, qais anim reperiri potest, tam improbas
civis, qua 'salit Cio. de petit. Consul. 3, ‘what citizense to be found
so abandoned as to wish3’ though this may be explained by sup-
posing that the constructionis quis caim repeirri potest qur 'velit the
tum improbas being merely ιιι apposition sentence expressmg inten-
sityolabhorrence.1n comparisons, however, with pum, the tam
is usually expressed, or, in lieu of rt, alitem though the practice οἰ
ellipsis before relative sormsis ιιιο common, that this ιι by no
means uniform. Thus, aaa tulit (sub. aliter), qttamsare debuit, Cic.
de Amic. 12. 42; aaa (sub. tum) facile loquor iaqrsit Quirites qstom
quoa lanatas sam presto, Liv.' ιι. 66. Nor do the corresponding
forms of demonstrative and relative answer to one another' ιιι other p
cases. Ihave noticed above the use of pacatas aster a compara-
tive, where it appears redundant, in the expression majore
ιιιιὶιιιο qaum qaaata mole, which is acase of this wantofcor-
respondente. So in Greek3 ἄλλος d' οὔτις μοι τόσον αἴτιος
οὗρανιώνων, ἆλλιὶ φίλη μήτηρ, Hom. Il. φ’. 275, where τόσος is
made to answer ιο ἄλλ ὰ, but it might be omitted with advantage,
in the same way as quantas above. So too a comparative adjec-
tive sometimes occupies the place of τόσως ιι, οὔτε ὕπνος, οὔτε ·
inp, γλυκερώτερόν ἐστιν . . . . ὅσσον ἐμοὶ Μοῦσαι φίλαι, Incert. In
other cases, as the relative and demonstrative both take a separate
subject, the forms of the relative and demonstrative are both
qualified hythe noun in their own clause3 as, dimicatio toties
qaot ιοιῄιιαιι, Liv. ii. 13, where qasot corresponds to the sub-
ject in its clause, which is conjurati, persons, not times. In the
next example, tum does not correspond ιο qaam, but ιο an abla-
tive absolute3 as, at, morte ιῘιι aaatiata, tam denique iel-
lam confectam arbitraretur? Cic. pro Muren. 16. 34.

Obs. Ihave treated these cases more at length, because our English
idiom differs very widely. The construction with qualis very generally
requires to be translated 'adverbially in English, and varies very much
even in Latin. Thus ιι is at one time used with talis, at another time
without, now in reference to the same subjectas thatin the antecedent
clause, and now with asubject of' ιιι own, now interrogatively, now adnu-
ratively, at another time intensively‚ and again in similes. In the fol-
lowing, quoted by Kriiger, on Attraction, vol.’' 11. 261, we have a peculias
instance: ssd incitatae pectas et mommae patres eqaiaa quales abero,
Hor. Epod. viii. 8, where quales ιι conformed to the gender os mammae,
contrary to what we have already seen, furnishing a case analogousto
othcr' instances of Attraction. In consequence, however, os not attending
to the peculiarity of construction which belongs to qualia Kriiger bas
