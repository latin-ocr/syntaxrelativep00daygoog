A TREATISE on PROPORTION; with a View to a fundamental
alteration m the method of teaching the Elements cf Geometry, and the simplification
of that part of it known by the title of the Theory of Parallels,1n which ιι shown how
Euclid' e Ι)Ἑ“ιιι1ι Book may be treated graphically‚ and the demonstratione at once con-
veyed to the eye of the learuer without the nee of Algebra.

“.Dr Day, of Brietol, hae published two small 'freahsee the snbectsof which are
closely connected together, and with that of onr present discussion, they are, let,

A New Exposition of Euclid, 18393 And, A TreetieeonProportion,1840.

“ln the first, the Doctrine of Parallels naturally occupies a conspicnonep lace,
while the writer’e speculatione on it are much illustrated ιιι the second. He treats the
whole question in a highly original and comprehensive manner, ae connected with
philosophicsl vrews of the system of Geometry, following ιιι the arrangement of his
deductione a very different order from that of Euclid, and most other writers οιι the
subject. Hisentire method sfounded on first treatmg the subject of trianglee, and
thence deducing that of Parallels3 sud thie by means of an introduction of the Doc-
trine of Propon-tion, at a much earlier stage ruthe course thanis usual A process to
which, abstractedly, no objection can, lthink, be found, and which ιι attended with
many inanifest advantsee .”—0o tlte i'ylceor ofPorollel Lim ,hythe Reo. Badeo Ροιιιι,
