the omission ofa consonant in composition, and in this way we might
suppose that quicum stood for euru quo, did not the existence of qui in the
sense of ‘how,’ and the form quis οι the third declension, render it pro-
bable that qui is really e proper ablative of quia.

9. It was noticed above, that many or most of the conjunctione had
arisen out of relative forms. Sometimes, however, the relative form is
itself wanting, and the conjunction is in reality a temnant os some inter-
posed verb, or otherwise the whole of such verb, which from customary
employment has corne to stand as a symbol of a connexion which is not
fully expressed. It will thus be perceived, that the employment of si, as '
a conjunction, constitutes no exception ιο the general rule; for, when
used alone, it is explicable on the supposition that ut or quod is elliptieal.
We have seen elsewhere, in my tract on the Accusative and Infinitive,
page 44, that some verbs, as fae, licet, regularly omit ut, and bave almost
or quite assumed the same nature as si. dt* is not, however, of equivalent

it ‘that3' as, for instance, minime est mirandum si et ejus uita suit
secura, Com. Nep. Cim. 4, in finem: quod contumeliosum soret ιι· equites
Romani traderentur, Sall. Jug. 65: and, in the same way, ei is used in
Greek in place of dn, or the Accusative and Infinitive. So stra μὲν
χρήματα λυπεῖ τινὰς ὑμῶν ε i διαρπασθήσεται, Demosth. Philipp. Δ. ιδ’.
Cherron. ιγ’, where the second el stands with the force of ὅτι, with the firr-
tber peculiarity of λυπεῖ used personally,by the abstractionof the subject of
διαρπασθήσεται. Si, like fue, is, beyond doubt, the imperative of a verb,
and stands either for siue, from sino, or belongs ιο some older form. The
relation between ἐᾶω and ei in Greek is os the same kind. This etymology
has been advanced by Horne Tooke, and it agrees well with all its ordi-
nary uses, in which its place may be supplied in English by ¹ grant that)
ln examples like those just quoted, it need not be made to depend on
mirandum or contumeliosum, the respective sentences being explicable in
the following way, ‘granting that bis life was secure, it is not wonderful ς’
⁸ which granting that the Roman horse should be delivered up would be
adegrading thing! Theseis, however, no necessity for having recourse
to this method of defending a supposition, as all such words by long usage
insensibly deelined from their strict original use. But by adopting this
hypothesis, we have et once an explanation of that extensive class of
examples, in which ιι· is joined with the relatives quis, qui, quaudo, in the
sense of quicunque, quandocunque. The two forces of - the Greek rec
interrogative and indefinite may have belonged, nay did indisputably
belong, to the Latin quir, and ιο some other words of this class, as may
be seen by the force of those ending in cunque,· and thus ss* quis has the
force of ‘grant that any,’ si quaudo, ‘grant that at any time.’ l know not
how otherwise to account for such expressions, since the supposition that
si is redundant is nonsensical‚ like most other suppositions os that class
which grammarians indulge in, when theywould spere themselves the
trouble of further investigation. The use of si with the subjunctive, as
in the instance, si nuuc se nobis ille aureus arbore ramus ostend ut,
Virg. AEn. vi. 187, ‘would that it might exhibit itself,' answering to the
Greek si, ε’ὶθε, is equally plain, the construction being, ‘suffer that it
appear3’ and this applies as well when o ιι· and the subjunctive is
employed. Sa' is also omitted, fors ita jusserit, Hor. Sat. ii. 1, 58 : fuerit
Lucilius, ibid. i. 10, 64. The words' uhi, uter, uude, are easily connected
