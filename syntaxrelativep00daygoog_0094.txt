omission of eny such mark, in its place3 and then fairly tc en·
counter the difficulty, which is, thet the relative has then no verb
with which it is connected, or the nominative absolute, qssipse
boantes, is put in plsce of a dative, or ablative absolute. But
although multique pridies boantibus, instead of quipse hecates,
would remove the difficulty, the letter is not so much at varismoe
with correct Syntnx ss would at first sight appear3 since, by
referring this to the class of instances above, the nominative is
in keeping with the general construction, the principle of which
seems to be, the introduction of another clause and subject besides
that to which the relative belongs, so that the qve indicates thot
the parties are different from those who recitc in the forum, and
qui is a nominative to evaneo in the sense of dem mont, or
locantur. Or, if this is deemed far-fetched and objectionable, put
s full point aster boantes and begin a fresh period at suove.
'fhough long since convinced, that some confusion has prevailed
with reference to such instances as are presented in this chapter,
and that the relative here only possessos the force of the copulative
and demonstrative pronoun, as has osten been noticed by others
in occasionsl examples‚ it is only lately that I have been led tn
generalius this principle3 and 1 shall now attempt to show, that
the relative may be freely used in ull the construetions of the de·
monstrative‚ instead of the same aud the copulative conjunction,
quite independently of its more understood legitimate use as a
strictly relative pronoun.

wlsiefs si or another relative is found. Thus in the following: qui

Them. 4: qui nisi decede sese iliam debiturum, Caes. B. G. i.

sit, Cic. in Cat. iii. 6, where quer has a distinct subject supplicatio
expressed, showing that the principle holds good both for the
pronominal use, and its use as an adjective. Agsin, pue cum ite
