33η naasson· or aursana-nonnus rnraaaoonwvrs. 73

9, sor cogitate quam pane tantis laboribus fundatam imperium aaa

noa delerit5 but qaam is omitted, tantis changed into quantis, and

then qaam is inferred by implication, or, in other words, the rela-

tive of the subordinate clause, which serves the office of conjunc-

tion, instead of belonging to the main verb of the subordinate

Ι clause, appertains to aparticiple in agreement with the object of
that verb.

(d) Ia simiks or comportans. Thus likewise two relatives occur
in the instituting comparisons of resemblance3 as, ὁποῖα κια-
· σὸς δρυὸς ὅπως, τῆσδ’ ἕξομαι, Eurip. Hecub. 895. Here ὅπως
seems to occupy the place of a demonstrative adverb, but it is
more probably amere redundancy, like that of ὁμοῖον ὥστε, Soph.
Antig. 583. Eurip. Orest. 686. See also Ptlugk's note to his
Hecub. 398, and Seidler ad Troades, 147. Another analogous
pleonasm is ἐνθάδ’ αὐτοῦ, elsewhere noticed by me. See also the
use of qaam, quantas noticed above, h 83, y.

(e) Doabla interrogativas. These instances are more particularly
deserving ol notice, because they have embarrassed the editors
considerably. Thus we have, τίδ’ ’ἐστι πρὸς τί, OEdip. Tyr.
lll3= rt ς οὗτος ἔσται, τί c παραῤῥίψει, ibid. 1459, not ri δ’ ἔστι
πρὸς dn, nor τίς οὗτος ’ἔσται ὅστις, where see Wunder's note: τῷ
τρόπῳ πόθεν for τίνι τρόπῳ πόθεν, Soph. Antig. 399. Philoct. 2413
ὅθεν rt, Eurip. Phoen. 43, where Matthiae places a break: πότε καὶ
παρὰ τοῦ καὶ rt λαβόντα τί δεῖ πονεῖν, Demosth. Philipp. A. ιγ’.
where, in addition to the accumulation of relatives in connexion
with λαβόντα, we have rt λαβόντα rt δεῖ. Again, rt ς τίνος
αἴτιός ἐστι, γενήσεται φανερόν, DendeConxy'. ποῖόν τί ταῦτ’
’ ἔλεξας 3 Phoeniss. 410, printed by Matthiae as two questions. See
other examples, Brasse's Antig. 2. The Greeks and Latius use
πότερος andater in the same way3 and the latter is used, when
' not interrogative, in a similar way, though its relative character is
then lost3 as, ambigitur quoties α ter atro ait petor, Hor. Ep. ad
August. 55: paam aterque utrique esset eaercitas ia coa-
epecta, Caes. B. G. vii. 35, in which last instance, aterque is the
same asperisque or ambo. So inGreek, πότερος ἄρα πότε-

’ ρον αἱμάξει, Eurip. Phoeniss. 1288: ὅπα πρὸς πότερον ἴδω,

Soph.Antig.1816. Somewhat different from the instances here
enumerated, but yet intimately related, is the passage, ἆρ’ οἷσθ’,
ὅτι Ζεὺς τῶν ἀπ’ Οἰδίπου κακῶν ὁποῖον οὐχὶ τελεῖ ; Soph.
Antig. 2. This passage has perplexed the commentators, but it is
now generally agreed that ὅτι, restored by Hermann, is preferable
to ὅ,τι, and the passage is thus explained, ‘knowest thou then
that Jupiter will accomplish what not of the evils derived from)
