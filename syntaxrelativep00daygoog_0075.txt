fallen intoerror, inquoting asirregular‚ quales nec condidiores
terra tulit, Hor. Sat. i. 5, 40. Here quoles should not be ablativa, by
reason of the comparative candidiores, though it is quite tme, that bad qai
been used, we must have put quibas. Quales ia here in its ordinary con-
struction, awant of attending to all the circumstances of which has led
many writers to treet of its construction in a way, which proves that they
do not clearly understand it.

ssa-As many of the uses of οἶος, the Greek equivaleut to
prolis, are peculias and similar, 1 shall bere examine a few of them.
'l'hus Ἕκτορ, τίς κέ α’ ’ἔτ’ ἄλλος Ἀχαιῶν ταρβήσειεν, οἶον δὴ
Μενέλαον ὑπέτρεσας, Hom. Il. ρ’. 686. Here οἱον takes the
construction of Μενέλαον, while it contains the force of ὅς, the
causal relative. As there'are, however, many cases iu which olas
is used with the force os the Latin ηυιινι, without any substantive
in the clause either expressed or implied, as for instance, 11. ν’.
483. o'. 287. φ’. 57. ω’. 419. ω’. 688, it may be argued, that
the example quoted is of like kind. lt has also the force of the
adverb ὡς or ὥστε, 11. ξ’. 295. o'. 555. ρ’. 471. It is not, there-
fore, always possible to determine whether it is used adverbially in
construction or not. Plato osten uses it where it appears to be an
adverb3 as, Men. 75, Ε. 87, Β. 88, B. Iu the following pas-
sages, it has the nature of a relative adjective3 ἀλλ’ οἶόν τινά
φασι βίην Ἡρακληείην εἶναι, ἐμὸν πατέρα θρασυμέμνονα,
θυμολέοντα, Il. e'. 639, where οἶος agrees with Ἡρακλῆς implied ln
the periphrasis. So οἷον ἀπώλεσε λαὸν Ἀχαιῶν, ibid. e'. 758,
and also t'. 447, without a substantive. Agar'n, οίος δ’ ἐκ νεφέων
ἇναφιιίνεται οὔλιος ἆστ ἡ ρ, λ’. 62. οἷον ἔρνος, ρ’. 53. aloc δ’ ἀστήρ,
χ’. 817. Another peculias instance is the oue following: ὦ φίλοι,
οἷον δὴ θαυμάζομεν Ἕκτορα dios αἰχμητήν τ’ ἔμεναι, καὶ
θαρσαλέον πολεμιστήν, Il. ε’. 601, where notice the further pecu-
liarity of ’ἔμεναι for ὡς ὄντα. Again, οὗ γάρ πω τοίους ἰ’θον ἆνίρας,
οὐδὲ thaam olo ν Πειρίθοόν τε, Δρύαντά τε, ποιμένα λαῶν, Il.
α’. 262. ὅτι οὗτοί εἶσιν οίους οἱ ἅνθρωποι καλοῦσι σοφιστάς,
Plat. Men. 91, B. ὄφρα ἴδηαι οἶοι Εὐθύφρονος ἵπποι, Plat.
Cratyl. 407, Ι). Hom. ll. s'. 221. sledda τάχα τοιοῦτον, οἷον καὶ
στ ν γ οὗ ντ’ ἐποικτίσαι, Soph. (Edip. Tyr. 1271, vvbere we might
. fill its place with ὥστε. Very similar to this is what follows: καὶ
τοιούτους ἀνθρώπους, οἵους μεθυσθέντας ὀρχεῖσθαι τοιαῦτα, οἶα,
κ.τ.λ. Demosth. Olynth. B. ζ’. Though manifestly an adjective in .
the following, we require to translate adverbially, ‘aa when,' τ οἶος
ἐὼν, οἶός ποτ’ ἐνὶ Τροίη εὐρείῃ πέφνον λαὸν ἄριστον, ιἰμῦνινν
Ἀργείοισιν, Hom. Οι1.λ’. 498. There are other examples in which
οἷος has an intensive force, corresponding with the use of qualis
aud qni, for talis or tantas, mentioned above3 as, πάντως, οίον
