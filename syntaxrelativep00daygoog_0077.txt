(b) Ιηιονοιαηρι os relative forata. 'l'he instance last referred to,
in the observation immediately preceding, exhibits a use of ὃς for
οἶος. So τοῖον . . . . παρεσκευάζεται ὃς δὴ εὑρήσει, AEsch. Prom.
Vinct. 9563 τοιούσδε μΰθους οῐς διαλλάξεις τικυα, Eurip.
Phoen. 445. In other cases cioches itself the force of ὅς, as, τὴν
πάλαι γένους φθοράν οἵα κατέσχε τὸν σὸν ἄθλιον δόμου, Soph.
OEdip. Col. 365. But this last possibly contains more, since the
φθορά referred to a series of calamities, of which those of OEdipus
only constituted a sample.

(c) Intensioe aod interjectional aser. of the former kind are
cases where τοῖος is used by itself 3 as, ἦ μὴν σὺ roborantem
ὠμὸς ὢν ἄγαν· τοῖος Φέρητος εἶσι πρὸς δόμους ἆνὴρ, ιι.τ.λ.
Eurip. Alcest. 64, and of the latter3 οἴμοι, τέκνου, πρὸς οἶα
δουλείας ζυγὰ χωροῦμεν, οἶοι νῷν ἐφεστᾶσι σκοποί, Soph.
Aj. 919. 'l'his double use of οἶος is extremely common, some of
which uses are mentioned below.

(d) Redundcncy. In the following we might omit οἷος without
inconvenience3 el μὲν γάρ τις ιἰνήρ ἐστιν ἐν αὐτοῖς οἶος ἔμπει-
ρος, Dem. Olynth. B. ζί yet it is better to retain it, as the sense
is, ‘if there be any man such as is skilled.' The passage further
exemplifies the use of a plural subject in connexion with a singular
relative, as τούτους follows, and this may serve to shed light on
the construction. 'l'his use of singular and plural,. with reference
to the same subject, is not confined to relative forms. Thus we
have, ὅταν προδῶσιν ἄνδρε ς, ob τίθημ’ ἐγὼ ζῆν τ ο ῦτ ο ν, Soph.
Antig. 1145.

p {tn-The use of ὅσος agrees with the general practice. Thus
first with antecedent elliplical; καὶ ἐποίησε σοφὸν ὅσα διδασκάλων
ἀγαθῶν εἴχετο, Plat. Men. 93, D. 94, A. Secnndly, in reference
ιο a subject in tle preceding member without πόσος, as, ἄλσος ἡμέ-
ρων δέν δ ρ ω υ ὅσα ἐστὶ τρωκτὰ, Xen. Anab. v. 3, 12. Thirdly,

after or in connexion with τόσος, but cyreeinp ιοὶιΙι α οροοιαι rub- ·

jeci iniis oum υἰαυυθς aS, ὅσση δ’ αἰγανέης ῥιπὴ ταναοῖο . . ..
τόσσον ἐχώρησαν, Hom. ll. π’. 589. ὅσσα δὲ δίσκον οὖρα
τόσσον ἐπιδραμέτην, ibid. ψ’. 431. Fourthly, affer affectiva of
quantity, as σολΰς 01· ιιᾶς. Τιιιιε, ξυντιθεὶς γέλων πολύν, ὅσην

latives the same as the Latin quantum. See p 33, (a) above, aud
in the expressions πλεῖστον ὅσον, θαυμαστὸν ὅσον. In addition to
these, it is said to be used for ὅς, but in many of these passages
it occurs after a word of quantity3 as, Σπαρτῶν πε λαὸς ἅλις,
ὅσος κεῖται θανών, Eurip. Phoeniss. 1235, where some copies
