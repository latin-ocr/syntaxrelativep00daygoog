CHAPTER I.

ELLIPSIS BEFORE THE RELA'HVE.

annn this head I shall collect together a variety of instances in
which the English language usually requires a fuller mode of
expression, and other languages commonly admit of it. It will
thus appear, that in using the word ellipsis, I do so less with a
view to insist upon any theory about the origin of such modes of
expression, than to adopt a convenient term sor olassification. It
is possible that, in many instances,the so-called elliptical form of
speaking may have preceded the customary use of the pterea locutio,
or may, to say the least, have been in much more general employ-
ment. 'Phe examples here brought together are collected merely
in the rough, some being of more and some of less frequent occur-
rence, and others again being borrowed from the practice of a
language different from that in which they are quoted. rhe
careful perusal os a body of examples such as these will not be
unattended with advantage to the student, as they are os exceed-
ingly frequent occurrence in the classical writers, and are in many
instances difficult of translation to the inexperienced scholar.
But in another point os view they are still more useful, as shedding
light upon the origin and use os the many relative adverbial forms
which everywhere abound, and os which we shall have to speak
more at large elsewhere. Such cases are very usual where the
pronoun ie may be supplied.
