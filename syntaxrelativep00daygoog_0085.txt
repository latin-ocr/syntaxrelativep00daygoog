tions, admit of apparently easy explanation. Ipresume aa to be of the
same origin as the Greek particle ἄν, which, from implying doubt and
conditionality, might easily come to be used as it is in Latin. Nc implies
the negative condition, while au has reference to the affirmative, aud there
is no difficulty in conceiving why the negative condition should precede⁶.
We do this commonly in English, 33 ‘he asked, should he not procecd,’
where the meaning implicd is, that the party wished to proceed3 and on
the contrary, the question is osten put affirmatively, where a disinclinatiou is
implied. This might be objected to, because aecae sometimes follows ne,
thus making both conditione negative, asin the example, necne lateam
necue incertum est, Cic. de Natur. Deor. i. 143 but in most instances the
first particle is omitted, and at all events, the tendency which verbs of
doubt and uncertainty have to take negative particles aller them may
explain this'. Or again, if we were to regard nec ae the double negative
as 33 affirmative, how does it follow utrum, attached to the affirmative
condition. The answer to this is, that ue, at first used negatively, settled
-dowu at last into a mere connective particle, when it became difficult to
distinguish whether it belonged more to the affirmative or negative mem-
ber3 and in corroboration of this we may adduce the forms aterne,
utrumne ⁸, quone, quantana, unae, and perhaps aecae, also quina for qui,

⁶ Against all this it may be objected, that ue, ‘not,’ and nd, ‘whether,'
are words of distinct origin, whose distinction is clearly marked by the
quantity of their respective voweIS, and that all here advanced is based on
the suppositiou of their identity. The fact that the Greek particle μή
however was employed iu both senses is decisive of the point, and it is
easy to conceive how the quantity would be determiued by circumstances.
The particle standing hy itself, as well as being emphatic, would receive
the whole stress of the voice, common in most other monosyllables, while
appended to another word, the previous ,syllable wotdd as easily take that
emphasis, aud the ue thus acquire in pronunciation only the value of
a short syllable. The employment of aum in 3 similar way, from the
Greek μὴ οὗν, contracted μῶν, renders all this matter of certainty.

⁷ This is, however, unnecessary: ne osten precedes, followed by on;
and the use of nouae, aecae, the former of which is sometimes supplied hy
au noa, shows clearly th'at the negative force has disappeared. The poets,
moreover, commonly enough use ne iu both members, 33 in the instance
nec ae, uec ue, quoted in the text, particularly when it is put as an enclitic;
thus, justitiaene prius mirer belliue laborum, Virg. AEu. xi. 1263 audon
the other hand, cu is sometimes put for ou aoa; 3ηά again, on is used
repeatedly in consecution, of which the first is frequently omitted. Aa is
used in the direct as well as the indirect question, ue mostly in indirect
questions, but also in direct, 33 ud patremne? Ter. Heaut. ii. 3, 72: meae
afferrepcdem? Virg. AEn. ii. 657 ; while uum is used in the same way 33
aa, generally, where the negative answer is expected, and ue is used for
num. They are all used as conjunctione, besides their interrogative use.
Thus we 333, 33 in some other instances we have seeu, that a primary
signification may be entirely lost, owing to a particular idiomatic usage
ll'ecomi'nbgl the type of others, where the primary signification is no longer

rscerm e.
