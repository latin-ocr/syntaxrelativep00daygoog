itself, and that aliquis -is only a particular case of, the use of its
principal component quie. In Greek, we distinguish the inter-
rogative τίς from the indefinite τις by the accent, though, doubt-
less, it is osten distinguished still further by its connexion. In
Latin, we have neither the accentual mark, nor should we always
have the same facility as in Greek, for distinguishing the inter-
rogative and indefinite use, were we confined to one form. Thus,
quia, when it stands by itself, is the interrogative, and to distin-
guish the indefinite, we addan initial mark, ati, by which all ambi-
guity isremoved⁶. This aliquia is again used as the indefinite
subject of an interrogative sentence, while quie is used as a definite
subject; as, aliquis dicet? or dicerit? ‘will any one say Ρ quisdicat?
‘who will say Ρ Where, however, uo ambiguity would ariae, the
quia retains its natural form. Accordingly, aster ei, aiei, ae, aum,
quum, which preclude the interrogative use of quir, being all marks
of conditional and dependent sentences, the ordinary form is pre·
served. lf this account of the matter be correct, there can be no
reason why aliquia should not sometimes stand in the place os
quir, even where there is no necessity sor this, and more especially,
where it is emphatic, and marks a ‘precise something,' supposed
in the condition. We find that this is the case3 as, aia uli-
quam rupertus sumptis spem pouit iu armis, Virg. AEn. ii. 6763
and so, I believe, usually aiter eiu, whose contrastive force gives to
the aliquam spem in this passage, the meaning of ‘any decided
hope? Alsa, qui ai alicujus injurie eibi remeius ficisset, aaa
faisse difficile carme, Caes. B. G. i. 14, where also alicujus is proper
for a similar reason, on which we shall again have occasion to
speak3 quibua est alicunde aliquia objectus labor, Ter.

colebant qui aliquid percipere atque audire studebant, verum
ctiam, ei qui forte simulabunt, ibid. 3. 6. Here the distinction is
most clearly marked: we have first qui aliquid in the prior part of
the sentence, and si qui in the latter 3 the meaning being, ‘not only
those who really did desire to improve themselves, but also those
who might perchance affert to do so.' Again, sepe, quum at i·
