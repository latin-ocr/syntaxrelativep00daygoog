vious examples3 and the other ἃ, the proper construction aster
ἐρωτᾷς, in the sense of‘ asking' While speaking of these passages,
. it is as well to notice, that Stallbaum defends the use of ὁπότερον,

Plat. Euthyd. 271, A, the relative adjective, in preference ιο the
mere interrogative form πότερον, in this and some other instrucre,
in English, ‘ 1 would wish ιο know which of the two you mean? So

6 63.-The relative, in the example which follows, stands both
as a subject and object; aa, οννιίο pac aut amia aar ecmcmariir
advorsa facta eunt, Sall. J. B. xiv. 16. This instance is quoted by
Stallbaum, in his note to the Charmides of Plato, 156, C, as illus-
trating a similar Greek passage iu the text, ὅτι τοῦτο οὕτω
λέγουσί rr καὶ ἔχει.

t tra-We have seen above how Stallbaum defends the relative
in preference to the interrogative form, and we must now advert to
others, in which he prefers the interrogative form to the indefinite
or ordinary relative form, where another relative has preceded.
We have aheady touched on some cases nearly allied, under the
head of double relative uses. Thus, ὅτῳ ri ποιεῖν ἢ παθεῖν riri
τοῦ πέφυκε, Plat. Phaedr. 271, Ar φροντιστέον ri ἐροῦσιν, erit.

6 65.-1n English, as in Greek, we sometimes make the article ·
precede the interrogative ; as, ‘The what i’ and sometimes where
the relative is not interrogatory3 as, ‘There is a history the
which observed,’ 11. Heu. IV. act 3. sc. l.

§ta—stallbaum notes a peculiar collocation with the, relative,
καὶ νῦν δὴ ii ἔλεγον, for ἃ ’ἔλεγον νῦν δή, ‘what l said but now,’
Plat. Euthyd. 288, Β, and quotes Garatonius ad Cic. Orat. pro
Mil. 16. 42.
