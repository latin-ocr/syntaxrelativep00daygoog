lowing, κατέναντι οὗ ἐπίστευσε θεοῦ, Rom. iv. 17, where our
translators have marked their notion of the structure by rendering
as follows, ‘by him whom ye believed, eren Gon!

φ47. Ια Greek, the relative very osten precedes the demon-
strative clause, and as in the examples in the previous section, the
demonstrative pronoun is very commonly separated from the ante·
cedent substantive, but so that the demonstrative pronoun, instead
of being placed first, comes last. This is of two kinds, lst, When
tae antecedent substantive is in tlte relative member. nnis will be
best understood by the following reference: ἃ γὰρ προσεῖδον νυκτὶ
τῇδε φάσματα δισσῶν ὀνείρων, ταῦτά μοι, δός,8ορ11.
Elect. 631. and, Wnen tae antecedent substantioe precedes the
relative clause. These examples are various, including the use of-
the artide and participle, where other languages use the relative,
and some of the adverbial cases approximate closely to the
examples of the demonstrative in the relative member, of which
Ihave brought forward cases in an earlier part of this work 3 as,
ἔλεγε δέ, ὅτιτὸ ἐκ τοῦ ιἰυθρώπου ἐκπορευόμενον ἐκεῖνο,
Mark vii. 20: ὁ λόγος ὃν ἐλάλησα ἐκεῖνος κρινεῖ αὐτὸν, John
xiim: ὁ ’έχων τὰς ἐντολάς, ἐκεῖνός ἐστιν ὁ ιἰγοτὼν, ibid.
xiv. 21. 26. xv. 26: perd τὸ ψωμίον, τό re, ibid. xiii. 27: droa
εἰμὶ, ὦσι μετ’ ἐμοῦ, xvii. 24. And thus it will hoppen, that
though the antecedent member may precede, still clauses exegetioal
of the antecedent will follow3 as, τάσδε συλλαβὼν ιἰρᾶς, ἃς σοι
καλοῦμαι, μήτε γῆς ἐμφυλίου δόρει κρατῆσαι, μήτε
νοστῆσαί ποτε, Soph. OEdip. Col. 1379. By attending to
what is here exhibited, we may explain the syntax of the following
passage: κούρην, ἣν ἄρα μοι γέρας ’έΕιλον oisc Ἀχαιῶν, ....
τὴν ἂψ ἐκ χειρῶν ἐλετο κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων, Hom. Il. rr'. 56.
Here κούρην is not a case of attraction, as some commentators put
it3 neither is τὴν the article, which would be nnhomerie, but the
pronoun ταύτην, and the usage is analogous to what we have seen
above. The following example contains a singular exemplification
of the practice of which we are treating‚ if it be not referable to

another principle: προαγορεύουσιν οἱ ἄρχοντες, ὃς ἂν τὸν ἐφιέντα

τὸν ὄνου είς τὰ ὅπλα μηνύσῃ, ὅτι λήψεται, Anab. ii. 2, 20, where ¹

the relative clause, dependent on the subject of the dependent
clause introduced by ὅτι, is put before it3 but we may regard this

Ξ argalogous to the ααουυοίὶυιιο prepositiones in the well-known
ree usage.

θαμειαί Observation. When a relative pronoun is connected with a
proposition, the preposition usually follows, though this is not mentiar to
the relative, aa, qaorum, quibuscum, quatenus, quorsum, qaam saper, quibas
