up and soltens the faulty Syntax of qaam poeacm mersit, which is her‘e,
notwithstanding, actually employed. The case will, therefore, fall under
the head of ‘Attraction of the Relative into the case of the Antecedent'

(λ) page 55. § 33. Similar to the Latin example, AEn. ἰ. 498. vi.

used3 olor δ’ ἀστέρα ήκε Κρόνου παῖς ιίγιτυλορητέω ..... τοῦ δ ε’ τε

(a) page 60. § 34, (a). Several good instancea in proof of this ten-
dency in οῑος forms, to agree with a noun in their clause, are here exhi·
bited with τοῖος, though this practice is less frequent with the demonstra·
tive than with the relative form, ὡς δ’ ὅτε τίς ...... (6νε lines inter»

pronominal for theadverbial use, or as a particular case of Attraction, but,
Ι conceive, that the most comprehensive mode of regarding it, is that which
refersit to aprinciple' such as Ι have attempted to establish. Again, τεττί-

οὕτως. These examples are of similar kind with the qualis and οἷος con-
structions, given in the body of the work, and differ from those in which
talis occurs alter qualis, in Latin. ln English we always make this con-
struction hythe adverb, and not by the relative or correlative adjective,
and in Greek and Latin it was principally retained with οἶος and qualis.
Thus in the Odyssey, where the language has undergone some perceptible
change from that of the Iliad, l do not think that any strictly analogous
examples are to be met with, at least, they must be very rare, from the
examination I have made, without, as yet, meeting with any. This agrees
well enough with what might be expected from the facts already ascer·
tained. The further wc proceed back in the history of the language, the
more reason we have for believing that the relative and demonstrative did
not exist separately3 and thuS, while we find in Homer the ὁ, ὅς, and
τός form interchanged, so οἷος and τοῖος are more nearly allied‚ than in an
aiter period, when a wider distinction took place between them, the latter
bearing a construction which was, inlater timeS, more characteristic of the
former.

(ν) page 61. § 34, (b) This use of ὅς aller τοῖος is Homeric, and is
met with Il. ω’. 182. Odyss. d. 776. λ’. 134. ψ’. 282.

(ξ) page 64. § 36, Obs. 4. It has been suggested already, page 58.
§ 33 (t), that in the use of qui aster tam, theton with its adjective, may
be merely an apposition clause belonging to the principal subject, with
which the quibas nothing whatever to do. On reconsideration, Ihave
no doubt that this is the proper explanation, but it may be put a little
more clearly than in the passage alluded to. Thus, in the instances, at acmo

qaam tam impudentem faisse qa ι’, dra, Cic. pro lege Manil. 16. 48: nemo

humilis, tam impudentem, tam injustas, being mere qualifications uf the
