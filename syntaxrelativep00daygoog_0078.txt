read ὅς. Accordingly, siler πᾶσαι we read boae eard βένθος ὅλος
Νηρηΐδες ἦσαν, Hom. ll. α’. 38, aud in an exactly similar passage
below, line 49, we read ai aster ἄλλοι. We have seen how οἷον
and oia have passed into adverbs; as, for instance, in the passage,
ὠκύμορος δή μοι, τέκος ἔσσεαι, oi’ ἆγορεΰεις, Hom. Il. α’. 95.
Thus too, ὅτε, and likewise ὅσα μή, for ὅτι μή, has grown hy usage
into a complete adverb. See Arnold’s Thucydides, book ich. 111.
line 6. This connexion between declinable and adverbial forms,
we shall point out more at large in the following section.

ο 36.-·Ιο closing this chapter, this seems to be the proper place
for remarking, that nearly all the adverbial conjunctions which eon·
nect dependent clauses with the verb iu the leading proposition,
darive their origin from some use οἵ the relative pronoun and its
various forms, or admit of explanation iu a manner precisely ana-
logous, by supposing ellipsis, transposition, aud attraction, either
singly or together, until usage has established them in a perma-
nent or absolute form, and they have come to be employed in a
great variety of arrangements. Thus, supposing ὅ and bn to be
the neuters of ὅς and ὅστις respectively‚ of which there is no
doubt, a relationship between the declinable and indeclinable form
is at once established, still further shown by the use of a for ὅτι

in Homer iu numerous passages3 as, 11. α’. 120. α’. 537. ε’. 433.

'Here seems a proper place to remark, that the Latin at, as a conjunction,
is used as the mark of an objectiva clause. It is not necessary, therefore, to

order that: as has sometimes been imagined. lu translating at and the
subjunctive hythe English present infinitive‚ we meet with many instances,
where ut may also be rendered by ‘in order that‚’ and others where this
translationis unsatisfactory. Thus, edo ut aivam, ⁶1 eat to live‚’ or ‘in
order that Imay live3’ but jubeo ut proficiscaris, or hortor alacribus,
carmot be well translated in any other way than, ⁴1 order you to set out,'
⁶ 1 exhort you to write‚' not ‘in order to set out,’ ‘in order that you should
write.’ It is better in these cases to suppose that ot, like ὅτι, which never
means ‘in order that,' is a general mark of the objectiva clause, and that
the sense of ‘in order that' is a specific meaning, explicable in common
with other senses of ut and qnod, by the supposition of ellipsis, or at least
of something mentally implied, but orally unexpressed. The New Testa-
ment writers often use iva and the subjunctive in these cases, where we
carmot translate by ‘in order that,’ which might seem to favour the idea
that al and ἵνα are of the same origin in both idioms3 but this will hardly
be considered to outweigh the evidence derived from its etymology. It is
possible, that in later Greek writers, ἵνα may have been putto correspond
exactly with vt, in cases where the usual meaning of ἵνα would not apply,
