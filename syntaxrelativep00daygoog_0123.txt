Oba. 1. From this rule would be excepted postquam, priusquam, dc„
in which the preposition may be regarded as governing a following clause.
We must here therefore suppose a mere ellipsis, of which the relative
clattse is explanatory, according to the explanation given below. So ut
in reference tc time ‘when' takes the indicative. In the cratia obliqua,
postquam is followed bya subjunctive for other reasons3 as, nuuc post-
quam ceruaut .. . . habeant quarum alterum latus Italia sit,
Liv. xxi. 30.

2. Το enforce and explain vvbat was said above on tbe common prin·
ciple involved in the use of potentia} and subjunctive, it may bere be
noticed‚ that mouet ut citet is as strictly a subjunctive, as reprehendat or
iutelliqat. Some verbs point out a circumstance, or inquire into one, and
are followed by a declinable relative, coupled with a subjector not, as' the
case may be, and the verb in the subjunctive3 or they require to be fol-
lowed by something expressing an act, which in Latin is either tbe infini-
tive, or ut and the subjunctive, and in English the infinitive. The use of
the infinitiva, cruland the subjunctive, is determined mainly by whether
the dependent verb (viz. the verb so placed in the infinitive or subjunctive)
is or is not the principa] object of the governing verb. lf the dependent
verb is the sole object of the verb preceding, then the infinitiva is usually
employed, or otherwise ut and the subjunctive. Now, when an actis
spoken of, a persona] agent is implied, and if the governing verb bas any
object besides the govemed verb, that object will be a person, which at
once explains the principle of the rule on this subject, given in my tractate
03 the Accusative and Infinitive, page ³8, 54, ‘⁶ All or most of the verbs
which would, aster the analogy of the English, appear to be followedby a
dative or accusative of the person, or by an ablative of the person, with ,
the proposition ‘from' before it, and 3 simple infinitive, allow or require
this inlinitive to be changed into ut and the subjunctive.” Iu many cases,
verbs will take either the infinitiva, or ut aud the subjunctive, according as
the personal object is intended to be prominently marked or not. The
accusative and infinitive, on the contrary, is made use of, when the word
in the accusative is not itself the object of the preceding verb, but consti-
tutes with the infinitive that object3 and hence the accusative is more
generally that of the thing than the person, the same verbs taking ut and

⁸ I do not know how long this principle has been developed in the shape
of a rule. Itis laid down in a short system of mles, prefixed to the later
ediciam of Ellis’s Exercises‚ by the author of the articles ‘Prosody’ and
‘Versification' in Dr. Rees's Encyclopaedia, and now again onuued in the
latest editions of that work, most probably, as being but badly adapted for
elementary instruction. Doubtless the principle has been osten noticed
before, as it has been by myself‚ before seeing the digest to which Ι have
referred; but I do not at present recollect to have seen it any where so
distinctly put forward as the foundation-stone of the whole doctrine.
