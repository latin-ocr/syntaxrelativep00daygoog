or alins, and where themselves usually put ῖνιοι; as, oi δὲ ἄλλοι
ιἰποῖλοντο χιόνος, καὶ ei τις νόσιρ, Xen. Anab. v. 3, 3, ‘others
perished in the snow, and some by disease,' if it is not intended to
say, ‘and possibly by discsse! On the other hand, the proper
relative pronoun is used instead of the indefinite with εἰ. Thus,
ἄν τινα δεινὸν οἴωνται εῖναι . . . . ὃν δ’ ἂν καὶ ἄλλους οῖωνται ποιεῖν

τοιούτοις, Plal. Euthyphr. 3, D, for idn dimna rai ἄλλους. Agna,

καὶ οὐδὲν οἶμαι κακὸν εῖναι τὸ ὑπομιμνήσκεσθαι ὅτι μὴ καλῶς, ἢ
πεποιήκαμεν ἢ ποιοῦμεν, Plat. Lach. 188, B, for εῖ τι μὴ καλῶς. To
which Stallbaum adds, Apolog. Socrat. 22, Β. ἅττ’ ἂν, Symp.
176, D; ὃ ἂν μέλλω πράττειν, Phaedr. 242, 03 and ὅτου δ’ ἂν,
ibid. 269, D. Of the use of ὅτι and ιῖ τι in the same connexion, 1
may add, rai ὅτι μὲν Μυκῆναι μικρὸν dmi εῖ τι ιι.τ.λ. Thucyd.

Obs. That si does not mark any thing hypothetica] is clear, at least, from
such a passage as this: nee si qaid olim insit Anacreon deiecit retas,
Hor. Od. iv. 9, 9, where the poet is referring to the preservation of
Anacreon’s spontive minstrelsy. We have already seen instances, in which
si has rather the force of nt, and in the following it appears to be used as
if for si qna, so that the relative is sometimes elliptical in this construction:
conati sant si possent perrumpere, Caes. B. G. i. 8. In Homer we find
tinore with the force of ῖνα οι· ὥστε : τε, κήρυκες βοόωντες ἐρήτυον, ei ποτ’
ἀϋτῆς σχοίατ’ &coniectandi Διοτρερὲων βασιλήων, ΙΙ. β’. 97.

b 50.-1t was stated above, that si qais enjoys all the properties
of the simple relative. Thus it is used,

(a) With ertpsnprecedtny it. As, epo hanc adibo si qnid me velit,
Ter. Hecyr. iii. 4, 153 which does not mean, ‘if he wants me,I
will go to him,' but, ‘I will go and see what he wants with me?

Obs. Perhaps this is in many cases rather a species of transferente with
change of case, adapted to the new position of the pais, as subject or object,
asin the following: at si qais opis ejns indigeret haberet qnod statim
daret, Nep. Cim. 4, where the dative of daret becomes nominative to
indigeret. Sa, cnm aliqnem rideret minas bene vestitam, snam amiculam
dedit, ibid, where we have aliquem as object to rideret, in place of
being a dative aster dedit. This construction is very common with the
indefinite, though Horace introduces this dative of the indefinite in the
following: qnid pacisque nitet nunqnam homini satis cantum est,
Od. ii.13,13. oin Greek, napi τοῦ τίνα τρόπον τιμωρήσεται τις
ἐκεῖνον ἐξέσται σκοπεῖν, Demosth. Olynth. B. a': εῖρηται ἐν ταῖς σπονδαῖς,
ἐξεῖναι παρ’ ὁποτέρους τὶς βούλεται ἐλθεῖν, Thucyd. i. 40. See also
examples§ 4. Obs. 2.

(b) With transposition into its tianae. As, per si qna est
qne restat adine mortatibns nsquam intemerata fides, Virg.
AEn. ii. 142, for per intemeratam fldem qnoecnnqae est qna: per
snperos et si qna f id es, ibid. vi. 459, for perfidem qna. Exactly
similar to this is the annexed·Greek example 3 πρός τ’ εῖ ri
