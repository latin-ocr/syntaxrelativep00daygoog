both likewise take ποτε, as τόν ποτε, Pind. Pythi. 16, here relative3 also
περ, as τάπερ, ἅπερ, besides other similar combinations.

An examination of the demonstrative and relative forms, both in Latin
and Greek, shows plainly that they have all the same origin. Thus,
hujus and cajus, hic and qai, are in reality the same words, since the
letters h, c, and q are osten no more than the symbols of an aspirated
vowel, as may be seen in the derivation of the English ‘whom' from
the Latin quem. Again‚ with regard to ὁ and ὅς, the aspirate shows that
there was something beyond the mere vowel-sound in the first of these,
which may have sometimes preceded and sometimes followed, or both
together. Thus, ὁ might become ὅς, οι even τός, though probably the
' reverse process represents the truth more nearly, viz. that which supposes
that the sibilant at the end was gradually sostened till it disappeared‚
while the initial breathing or r cameto be represented by the aspirate
mark. In Latin, by a similar method, we might obtain s'q (hic) or qt
(qui)³. The distinction between the foc and τος, οι relative and demon·
strative form, hasbeen well preserved in English3 as, for instance, in
‘whose’ and ‘those3’ and it would be interesting, could we make out
a complete history of these modifications. With regard to Home Tooke’s
derivation of qai from rol οἵ, adopted from Voss, l hardly know what to

· say. Undoubtedly, in many instances‚ the relative pronoun can in signi-

fication be resolved into the copulative conjunction and demonstrative3
and in consonancc with this is certainly the frequent use of re in Homer
aster what is called the relative 3 as, κεῖται α’νὴρ ὄντ’ ἴσον ἕτισμενἜιτορι
δίρ, ΙΙ. ε’. 467. See Trollope's note, who quotes Hermann to the effect
that ὅς originally signified hic, and ὅστε the same as qui, or ct hic, a force
which the relative osten possesses, both in sense and construction, as we
shall elsewhere see. Another good instance to the same effect is dre
προΐδωσιν ἰόντα Κίρκον,ὅ τε σμικρῇσι φόνον φέρει ὀρνίθεσσιν, ΙΙ. ρ’. 756.
Βιιι, on the other hand, the aspiration of ὅς in Greek admits the suppo-
sition of some consonantal sound before it, having the same force as the
digamma, or English ιι, which is equivalent ιο the qu of the Latins, and
answers to the old orthography of ‘whom,’ as found in some authors,
qiam. Even‚ however, supposing this to be fanciful, there was still a roc
form in Homer, preserved in the oblique cases, which bears the same
relation ιο ὅς as τόσσος ιο ὅσσος, as tolia or tantus to qualis, quantus in
Latin, or as the English ‘those' to ‘whose’ That the relative is osten
equivalent to the copula and demonstrative, that the demonstrative and
copula osten fill its place, particularly in the earlier dialects, and that the
Latius often render the latter by qai, are points beyond dispute, and all
tending to render the derivation of qui from καὶ ὅς feasible3 still I do not
think the etymology at all demonstrated, though it appears more satis·
factory than the majority of such derivations usually are.

³ That the final c in these cases is amere ending, which has nothing to
do with the root, or which is indicative of a peculiar sound sometimes
given to the vowel, seems to be established from the forms hic, hi, singular
and plural, ne and uec, harum and harunc, the Greek νῦν and Latin nunc,
the termination hoc in the ablative compared with other ablatives in o, that
of hunc compared with amin other accusatives, the ending ce attached to
some words, as his, hisce, also by comparing illuc and illud, istuc and
istud, quicquam and quidquam, and the German hia with the Latin binc.
