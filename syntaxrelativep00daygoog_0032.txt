§la—The relative is osten elliptical in English. Resides the
many cases in which the conjunction ‘that,’ answering to the
Latin relative at, is lest out, we have such as these z—‘l have two
boys, seek Percy and thyself about the field,' Shakesp. I. HenryIV.
act v. sc. 4: ‘in the fair rescue thou hast brought to me,' ibid:
‘than those proud titles thou hast won of me,' ibid: ‘there's some
great matter she'd employ me in,' Two Gent. Veron. act iv. sc. 3 ι
‘she loved me well, delivar'd it to me,' ibid act iv. sc. 4.

sla-ln certain customary phrases, in appellations, and in
particulare of admensurements, such as content, height, distance,
breadth, &a the relative is osten not employed3 as, ἀφικνοῦνται ἐπὶ
τὸν Μάσκαν ποταμὸν τὸ εὖρος πλεθριαῖον, Xenoph. Anah. i. 5,4:
irruitis ἦν πόλις ἐρήμη, μεγάλη, ὄνομα δὲ αὐτῇ Κορσωτή, ibid. '
'l'here is likewise acommon species of ellipsis iu Greek and Latin, ’
which has become so usual that we hardly notice it, in the phrases,
’ἔλεξε τάδε, ἐ’λεὲε or ’ἔλεγεν ταῦτα, τοιαῦτα ἔλεγε, τοιάδε εἶπεν, davit
bac, dtur tarta. These phrases refer, as is well known, to some·
thing previously narrated, or subsequently to be narrated, and,
consequently, the pleno locatio would he, in English, ‘such as we
have related,' or ‘such as we are about to relate 3’ or os a narrative
already stated, ‘such was the statement 3' and of one to be given,
‘he said as follows! ln this use the demonstrative pronoun is
osten repeated in Greek3 aa, τοιάδ’ ἤκουεν κακά ..... τοιάδε
λέγω, Eurip. Hecuh. 571-’575

t 19.-It may he objected, perhaps, to many examples that we
might quote from Greek, that they illustrate'equally well ellip'sis
of some other kind, as, for instance, of the participle. But as the

. participle stands for the relative and finite verb iu many instances

in Greek, the cases are at least analogous, and in the selectiou of
examples below I shall regard them as such. Thus, ὁ ἡγησόμενος
οὐδεὶς torar, Xen. Anah. ii. 4, 5, ‘there shall be none who will act
as guide.' The transition from the participle to the direct con-
struction is certainly an equivalent change to that which we are
considering. Even if we suppose that the Greeks preferred the
direct to the relative construction, it is not out of place to iutro-
duce the examples here, as there is still the same departure from
the analogy of our own language, where the relative is in use; and
to the English student of the classics it is most important to dis-

tinguish these differences in the practice of the several languages. '

(α) lkoasitioa from participle to finite oerb. This is common in
the N ew Testament 3 aa, διὰ τὴν ἀλήθειαν τὴν μέν ο υ σα ν ἐν ἡμῖν,
καὶ μεθ’ ἡμῶν ἐ’σπαι, 2 Ep. John, i. 2: τὸ πνεῦμα καταβαῖνον
καὶ ἔμεινεν, John’s Gosp. i. 32: τοὺς λέγοντας ἀποστόλους
