writers have erred, in ranking under one special rule cases more
properly belonging to another special rule, where, however, both
rules are but particular exemplificatione of one general law.

b 73.-1t must, nevertheless, be admitted, that the Latine were
much more rigid in the observance of their syntectical rules than

the Greeks, with whom they shared a kindred language3 in so
much so, that of the deviations from striet rules of which they were
sometimes guilty, the greater part were direct imitations of Greek
idiom3 and the style of many Latin authors determines pretty
nearly the ¹tentent of their fondness for, and acquaintance with,
their great literary precursors among that favoured race. The
employment of the subjunctive atter the relative, of which I am
about to speak‚ was not a Greek practice ¹3 for although the
optative does occur atter relative particles, in certain connexione,
where, and for the same reasons that the subjunctive occurs in
Latin, thiais only in particular cases, and to a limited extent. Of
this practice 1 shall say something further below. However closely
the two languages may in many points correspond, it does appear
that the Latins had greatly refined upon the practice of the Greeks
in this respect, and that they adhered with great uniformity to
their own rule. There is no question, too, that this rule enabled
them to eonvey, with great accuraey, some nice distinctions, most
important to the full and perfect understanding of what they
wrote, and more especially valuable to those who have now to

¹ This must be taken with due qualification. ln one point of view, the
Greeks may be said to have carried the practice further than the Latias,
in as much as they had two meede, optative and conjunctive, and these
modified by the introduction or omission of ἄν, or κε, κέν in Epic, after
relative words. Thus, afterqb'c, ὅστις, olor, dre. where the relative does
not mark a definite person or thing, but merely a probable, or supposable‚
or supposed case, the optative is used with or without ἅν, according as the
relative sentence is to be represented as dependent on some condition, oris
merely a supposition arising in the mind of the writer or speaker. Thus,
after universal negative propositions, the optative with ἄν in the relative
sentence is common, in the same way as the subjunctive in Latin; as, οὔ r
ἔστιν ὅτι ἄν τις μεῖζον τούτου κακὸν πάθοι, Plat. Phaed. 89, Ι).
So, too, in interrogative sentences3 aa, rat rte ποτ’ ἐστὶν, ὄν γ’ ἐγὼ
datto ιμί τι, Soph. OEdip. Col. 1167. And thus, too, when the pronoun
is used indefinitely without a direct reference. Again, when a relative
clause follows a verb in the optative, ex ressing a wish 3 as, ὁπ πότεροι
πρότεροι ὑπὲρ ὅρκια πημήνειαν, δέ σφ’ ἐγκέφαλος χαμάδις ῥέοι,
Hom. ll. y'. 299. In the oblique oration, particularly after λέγω, sparto,
εἶπον, when it is intended to mark that the opinion is expressed by the
speaker, not the historiari, as in Latin. See Matthia, Griech. Grammatik,
