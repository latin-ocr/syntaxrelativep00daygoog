12 navarrrron os ‘rus annectantur. [cn. 11.

2. To the examples last named, 59. (b) and also Obs. 1, belong a
numerous class of instances, in which the neuter pronoun id is commonly
regarded as elliptical; not but that the practice of the Latin writers would
lead us to suppose, that it was much more frequently absent than present3
as, qnid eo postulet pervidendam, Cic. de Finib. v. 16: deinceps uidendam
est qaae sit hominis natura, ibid. v. 12: qaid sit primum est videndam, ibid.
Tusc. Quaest. i. 9. Itis hereat once obvious that the relative clause
may be regarded as the nominative to the impersonal verb, or id may be
supposed to be wanting. But, on examination, instances of this sort will
be found t0 be similar to those just named above. The relative clause is,
in reality‚ objective to the impersonal verb, as is proved by the use of the
subjunctive mood in cases of this kind, and by the analogy of the phrases,
utendam est opere, fruendum esthono. Isidis supplied, therefore, it does
not stand as an antecedent, but in mere apposition, and is to be regarded
as objective to the foregoing verb. In English, when a relative sentence
is the subject osan impersonal verb, the ‘it’ is always expressed, when
the verb comes first3 but if the relative sentence is placed first, there is
no need of the impersonal symbol of the subject. Thus we say, either, ‘ it
makes no differente whether you stay or go,' or ‘whether you go or stay
makes no differenoe!

p 10.-The subject of ellipsis as containing the explanation of
the use of a great number of relative particles and adverbs will be
afterwards resumed, when we have first explained some of the
peculiarities of the relative pronoun well deserving of minute
attention.

CHAPTER Il.

REPETITION OF Tus ANTEGEDENT.

p ll.—Having thus treated, at some length, the subject of
ellipsis, I pass outo notice some instances in which the antecedent
is repeated in the relative clause, and may be said to be redundant.
These instances, though not very common, are easily understood,
and require no particular comment. Perhaps Caesar most abounds
in this practice3 and, indeed, it is easy to see that it suits the
accuraey of historical detail, much better than it consists with the

concise elegance of mere literary composition. Thus, eram omnino

itinero dno quibus itineribus, Caes. B. G. i. 6: diem dicum quo

d ie, ibid: ut semel Gallorum copias proelio vicerit, qnod proe l ium, ·

ibid. i. 31: in castris Helvetiorum tabule reperte sant, quiae ia
tabulis, ibid. i. 29: insula de quihsiasulis, ibid. v. 13: in eo
parte, qaam ia partem, ibid. iv. 32: oti γὰρ ἀνὴρ πρόπαν ἦμαρ
ἐς ἠέλιον καταδύντα ἄκμηνος σίτοιο δυνήσεται ἄντα μάχεσθαι... .
