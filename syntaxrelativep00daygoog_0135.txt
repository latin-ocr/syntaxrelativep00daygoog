those whomsoever they conquered.' This passage, too, would be
differently classed by different parties. Some would say that it
depends on the rule given below, that with a verb in the subjunc-
tive imperarent, the relative clauses essential to the sense of the
whole proposition have likewise the verb in the subjunctive;
others, that the relative clause following the accusative and infi-
nitive, and containing the statement of another, requires this3
or, without regarding either of these ruleS, some would say, that
the condition expressed by the relative clause is not definite, but
hypothetical.

Oba. When the relative clause, following an accusative and infinitive,
does not contain the sentiments or reasoning of the party who is the subject
of the verb that renders the construction oblique, theu the indicative is of
course usual. Thus, scire ipitur oportet onnia lepumina, quaeqae ea sru-
meatis panificia aaut penaria ualentissimi esse, Cels. ii. 18: quominus
miram est opas pistoriam ualentissimum essequod ea frumento, adipe, melle,
caseo constat, ibid.

b 82.-When the relative with its clause is introduced, not as a
mere extension of the principal subject, or as merely explanatory
of the subject, but contains an emphatic grourffl or reason implied
why something was done, or a defining circumstance of great
importance to the sense of the passage, then the subjunctive is
found in it. In the examples which follow, each of the relative
clauses might be rendered by cum and the subjunctive; they con-
tain areston why such a man would not suffer the republic to be
overthrown, or why the inference of the writer had been formed 3
and they give great emphasis to the statement. Thus, non ert
passus ille air, qai sceleratissimos noes, qui acnnmos noctu, qni
munimus nationes, qai repes, qni pentes feras atque inauditas, qai
praedonum infinitum manum, qni etlam seruitia virtute materiaque
domuisset; qni omnibus bellis terra marique compressis, impe-
rium Populi Romani orbis terrarum luminis definisset, rem-
publicam anerti scelere paucorum qaam inse nouaclum consiliis, aed

Oba. In all these examples, the difference of meaning between qai with
the indicative and subjunctive is plain enough. ln the first, qai and its
clause is not a further designation of the particular air, but is an essential
