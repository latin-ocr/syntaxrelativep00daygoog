part of the subject of portur ert, without which the proposition would have
no meaning, in English, ⁶ aman who had so distinguished himself was not
theman to suffer the republic to be overthrown.’ In the third example,
qui is not a mere extension or further explanation of Menapii, but statesa
fact which explains why Caesar led bis army there, in English, not because
‘certain Menapii who were in arms remained,’ but because ‘the Menapii
were in arms, and he must subjugate them! And in the fourth, the relative
clause also contains a reason why the Harudes could so easily effect their
purpose, although the subjunctive might have been used on independent
grounds. The meaning here is not that ‘certain Harudes, viz. those who
had lately crossed into Gaul, were layiug waste their territories,’ but that
⁴ the Harudes, from having lately crossed over, were embracing the oppor-
tunity thus afforded them of doing so.’ Instances, however, do occur,
where the indicative is used; as, neque rendendum censeo qaae libera nt,
Ter. Adelph. ii. 1, 39, ‘nor dol think that one who is free is to be sold.’
But here the individual spoken of is present, or hasbeen so but a moment
before, and the meaning may be ‘nor do l think that she (pointing to her)
is to be sold, a person who is free.’ The indicative or subjrmetive occur
in examples of this kind according as the observation is general or par-
ticular.

b 83.-The use of qui eausal, as it is termed, approaehes nearly
to the one just mentioned, and the subjunctive follows it in this
signification3 as, acmnes eum qui se pradalia munierit, non
ut tc oppugnaret, sed ut vitam suam posset defendere, Cic. pro Sext.
36. 78: qui gnatum haberem tali ingenio preditum, Ter. Andr.
i. l, 71: attulerimus iter facere pedibus qui incommodissime naui-
gassemus, Incerta Laocoonta fuant samum qui cuspide robur
ln serit, Virg. AEn. ii. 231 ε qni mm tantam in me et potestatem
habeam tanta astutia, Ter. Heaut. iv. 3, 32: qai non absti-
neas manum, ibid.iii.3,4= qui me hinc eatrudas, ibidiii.
3, 28: satin' sanus es qni me id rogites, ibid. Andr. iv. 4, 10:
carmeyo igitar rogem? qui hic nerninem alium uid e a m, ibid.

Oba. In many cases of this kind, qui may be rendered iu English by
‘seeing that.’ The indicative is found in some editions} thus, infelix!

qui consponsae praecepta furentis audierat, Virg. AEn. ii. 345, which
is changed to audierit in other copies.

j asa-The two preceding rules might have been included, with
some others which follow, under the more general one now to be
given, viz. ‘That whenever the relative clause is absolutely
necessary to the sense of the whole proposition ⁵, or consti-

⁸ ln a certain sense, the relative clause is essentia] to the meaning in
propositione like the following: jam faciam qnod aubia, Hor. Sat. i. 1,16:
trahit quodcunque potest, ibid. 343 but faciam and trahit would both take
a simple word for their object, of which the quod may be regarded as
explanatory. But quivis, quilibet, quadrellis, quodcunque potest, are

mere periphrases or general formulae. See above.
