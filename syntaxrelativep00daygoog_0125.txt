lvoec cnm uiderem qnid agerem ,indices ibid. pro Sext. 1943:
nocenim ipsnrn utilepatcre, qn o d turpe sit calamitosam ert,ibid.
de Off. iii.12. These instances are mostly cases of the potentia13
but this is of no consequence. Likewise when an adjective stands
in lieu osis or hic,· as, equidem andito dico quaesreqnentin
firmil, Cic. pro Sext. 33. 72. Or when the relative clause is made
by nt and the subjunctive3 as, illud ocius entorqnebis, nt nac
oculo contenta sit nno, J uv. Sat. vi. 53.

(b) In some particular phrases, the indicative occurs, where,
according to the rule, we should expect a subjunctive3 as, sed noc,
nescio quomoda frequenter r'n rne congessisti, Cic. pro Plane. 34. 833
but it is to be observed here, that nescio qnia, and its cases, nescio
qni, quomodo, ⁸5⁰· must be regarded as parenthetic phrases, on which
the verb does not depend, in English, ‘ but thou hast heaped on
me, Ι know not how,' &c

(c) It is hence evident, that if an ellipsis of the demonstrative
takes place, there will still be instances in which the subjunctive
is proper, if it be proper to use it where that demonstrative is
expressed3 and this brings us to the development of the hinda-

mental principle involved therein, viz. that the mere ellipsis of
the demonstrative or antecedent member does not constitute the
relative clause an objective one3 for although it seems to fill the
place of the object, in these cases, it is osten only an explanatory
or apposition clause, not absolutely necessary to the completeness
os the proposition, as we shall presently see. Thus it ¹happens that
the very same verbs will take a relative clause alter them, either
with their verb in the indicative or subjunctive, as the case may
be; as, qualis esset natura montis et qualis in circuitu ad
stertens qni cognoscerent rnin't, Caes. B. G. i. 21, where the object
to cognoscerent is qualis esset natura montis. On the other hand,
qne ipnornbant de L. Domitii firgo cognoscunt, ibid. B. C. i. 20,
where the meaning is not ‘they learn what they were ignorant of
with respect to the ssight of Domitius,' but, ‘they learn the fact os
Domitius's ssight, a circumstance of which they were ignorant,' to
which mode of interpretation qne in the plural offers no real
impediment. In the following, the relative clause is merely expla-
natory: nnc eninr nna nos cnm coetercs res turn quod est diffi-
cille’rnnm, Cic. de Legg. i22. And in this both indicative and
subjunctive occur aller the same verb, coupled with aconjunction:
el qnid te epo velim, et qnod tn queris, scies, Ter. Andr.
iii. 3, 4, ‘you shall know what I want with you, (which as yet you
know nothing about) and a fact which you seck to know (inde-
