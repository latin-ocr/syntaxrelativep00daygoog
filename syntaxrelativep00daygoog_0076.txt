60 Αττιιιιοτιοιι wira olor, ὁποῖος. [on. vr.

ἐμόν γε μέ νος καὶ χεῖρες ἄαπτοι, οὐκ ἄν με τρέψειαν, ὅσοι θεοί εἶσ’
ἐν Ὀλύμπῳ, ll. θ’. 450. νῦν δ’ alvide δείδοικα ποδώκεα Πελεέωνα
oloc ἔκεένον θυμὸς ὑπέρβιος, οὐκ ἐθελήσει, α’. 261.

(ο) Attroction. The examples which follow are quoted as ex·
emplifying what is called ‘Attraction3' λόγους οἵους εἰς τὰ
δικαστήρια, Plat. Euthyd. 272, A. See also Stallbaum's note, and
Matthiae's Gr. Gr. b 473, obs. 2. πρὸς ἄνδρας τολμηροὺς, οἵους
καὶ Ἀθηναίους, Thucyd. vil. 21. τὴν δὲ γυναῖκα εὗρον, ὅσην τ’
ὄρεος κορυφήν, Hom. Od. κ’. 112. πρὸς οἵους ὑμῖν Ἀθη-
ναέονς ὄντας, Thucyd. i. 70. But in all these cases no verb is
conceived of as catering into construction with οἷος in its own
clause, and judging by the examples given above, there is no
deviation from the ordinary practice, it being more according to
Latin and Greek practice to indulge this construction; and l am,
therefore, inclined to doubt the propriety of treating them as ex-
ceptione, as is evidently implied in putting them under the head
of ‘Attraction' Analogous passages exist in Latin, as in the pas·
sage, qualem ιἰι toto Graecia neminem, quoted from Cicero
above. The uses of the interrogative form ποῖος, and the olor
interjectional or admirative with the demonstrative pronoun men-
tioned above, ch. v. πρὸς ποῖον τόνδ’, Soph. Philoct. 564.
olov τέινδ ε dodones βοήν, ibid. Aj. 327, are of the same class
Thetis, these οιος forms habitually melt, as it were, two construc-
tions into one, and thus the interrogative and demonstrative are
put ln the case of the preceding subject 3 as, ποέοισι τούτοις,
Soph. OEd. 001384.. Another example of this attraction occurs
here3 ιἰνδρὸς οὐδαμῶς οἵου τε ψεύδεσθαι, Dem. Olynth. Β. Z‘.
The same thing takes place with ὁποῖος, as, οὐκ ἔσθ’ ὁποῖον
στάντ’ ἂν ἆνθρώπου βίον οὔτ’ αἰνέσαιμ’ ἂν οὔτε μεμψαίμην ποτέ,
Soph. Antig. 1135, where the construction is that of the relative
ὅς with the antecedent subject βίος transferred into its clause.
Looking at the passage as it stands, we might say, that οὐκ ’ἐσθ’
ὁποῖον stands for οὔτινα οι· μήτινα. Again3 ἐρώτα δὲ αὐτοὺς
ὁπ ol ω ν τινῶν ἡμῶν ἐ’τνχον, Xen. Anab. v. 5, 15.

obs. There is certainly some little confusion in the minds of many

syntectical writers with reference to these forms. Imentioned above Δ

indicatione of this. Professor Sandford‚ in his Second Greek Exercises‚
gives instantes of the singular relative aller a plural antecedent, but is not
· so fortunate inhis illustration of the use of plural relatives atter singular
antecedente 3 for in his first example, οἶος, as 1 have shown above, is both
in Latin and Greek made to agree with the substantive in its own clause,
either expressed or implied, and ὅσος is similarly used. Ιιι the third
example given by him, ὅς enjoys the same privilege, for the very reason
that it is there put with the force of olor, analogous examples to which in
Latin l have already supplied.
