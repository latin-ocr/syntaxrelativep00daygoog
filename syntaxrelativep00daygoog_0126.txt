pendently of my information),' where the' differenee between the
objectivc and explanatory clause is clear enough. In the following
example, the principle is still more clearly marked, for we have an
indicative clause in appositian with the subjunctive: tate ἱρέων,
quad ee nse pressisti, qui essent optimates, Ciepro Sext.
63. 132. Here qui essentis strictly objective, and the subjunctive
marks the dependence on presul& since the phrase querere qui
eram would mean, ‘to seek those known persons who were noble‚'
while querere quiessent means, ‘to seek to know who were and
who were not noble‚' a sufficient difference, the first construction
making qui an explanatory clause os some definite, though unex-
pressed, party3 and the second making the whole clause an object
ol inquiry. In conformity with this we have qaod praesuli after
habes, expressing a known and determinate condition. Notice
here, however, that both clauses may be conceived of as depending
on labet, the one in the indicative, the other in the subjunctive ; or
the subjunctive clause may be regarded as filling the place of prod,
and being governed by quesisti. Again, sed recordare qai tum
fuerint consulum nomiae lose,- qui aaa siverunt-sed ad-
emerunt, Cic. pro Planci0, 35. 87. The first subjunctive marks
adependence on recordare ; the indicative, in the following clause,
indicates that the second qui is merely explanatory of hostes Let
us take now the followingz mirari se aon samfflporum numm haberi
pai supplicibus eorum nocuissent, aut aaa pauculus poeais
affici qui relipioaeu minuerent, priam qui fana spoliarent,
Nep. in Ages. 4. Here the pui appetebas earum madescat, by
reason of the' ellipsis of eos, becomes the accusative of the subject
to habei; but that is not the reason why commeat is in the sub-
junctive, this being due to another principle to be hereatter named,
viz. the use of the subjunctive in the relative clauses, dependent
on epreceding accusative and infinitive in the oratio obliqua. Or
we may say thet qui does not here relate to any specific individuale,
but designates a class, and thet the clause is hypothetical, requiring
in English a potentiel sign, ‘those who should huit? The inde-
finite relative in Greek is also followed by the optative and con·
junctive.

(d) In order to free this subject still further from misccnception,
and to show the universality ot' the rule, I shall now allude to
another class of instances, in which the student may find some
difficulty in the application of the principle 3 such as the phrases,
suut qui dicarat, reperti suut qui insilirent, quod eis iuvenitur qui
desideret pluriam, Cic. de Off. i. 19, &c of which mention will be
made presently. Here it may be said, that these verbs take no
