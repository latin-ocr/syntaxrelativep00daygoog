124· sacamentum rou ur ann anon auru. [cn.x1v.

t aa-The relative and the subjunctive are often used in
place of the English ‘that' with the potential, or of the simple
English infinitive present; aa, qui copuoscereut misit, Caes. Β. G.
i. 21: iiiuc demus quisruatur, Ter. Adelph. v. 8, 27.

Oba. But, even in cases of this kind, an indicative occurs, when the
writer chooses to look rather to the fact than the intenti0n3 as, certos
mittit homiues ad infimos montes qui obuii e r o ut itineri aduersariorum⁸‚
Nep. in Epam. 9: eliquatur principes qui jura reddunt, Tacit.
Germ. 12, where, however, the meaning is perhaps merely, ‘that the
princes are elective, and that the dispeusing justice is entrusted to them.’

§aa-ln the same way, quia and quod, though not strictly
resolvable by ut, both contain in themselves the force of the
English ‘ that,' and are followed by a subjunctive. Quod, in the
sense of ‘because,' is not necessarily followed by a subjunctive ;
but in many cases this force seems to obtain where it is so used,
because a causal may still be necessary to the sense of the whole
proposition. Thus, after verbs of praising, blaming, or accusing,
the relative and subjunctive follow more particularly, inasmuch as
they contain in themselves the terms of the commendation or
charge, not the reason assigned by the writer. Quia is evidently

a composition of qui aaa, and quod, signifying ‘that' or ‘because' ,

is, as elsewhere seen, of the same origin as the neuter of the relative
pronoun. In fact, the demonstrative pronoun is osten found pre-
ceding it, as in the examples subjoinedz incomprehensaque
eu preda tripodem aureum Delphis posuisset, Nep. in Paus. l: iu eo
reprehendit, quodproeter modum dicat erre, Cic. pro Plancio, 33. 82;
for although eo is usually regarded as redundant, and standing in
apposition with the whole relative clause, there is no doubt that in
the original mode of viewing the construction it was demonstrative
to quod as the relative pronoun‚ but afterwards omitted or retained
at pleasure, when quod came to be regarded more as a conjunction.
Quia, with its verb in the subjunctive, is found aster propositione
containing or implying a negation, or expressing an obstacle or
doubt. Hence it is common aster duhto, uultur est, viu reperitur,
quis ert? quid causa est? eo inficias, and where interventionis
implied. The following are examples: uou dubitabat quia ei cre-
deremur, Cic. Attio. vi. ep. 2: uua cunctandum existimauit, quia

⁶ This passage is perhaps, however, to be understood differently, by
making obuii agree with montes, ‘which lay in the route of the enemy,'
though obvius est has the meaning of ⁴ meet’ in other passages, as quicunque
obuius est, Hor. Sat. ii. 6, 51 : obuius ei suit Empbyietus, Nepos, Phoc. 4.
