j era-As the verbs volo, nola, malo, are often put in the present
subjunctive, bya mere idiom, as well as some others in the present
and perfect subjunctive, merely as a modest qualification, the use
of the relative in such connexions is not peculiar. 'Phe use of the
perfect, to which l refer, is one of extremely common occurrence
in our own language, in the phrase, ‘nor would l essert? Thus,
too, in Latin3 aee tamea affirmaverim mallem ommam
venam arpentum aurumne pipam, Tacit. Germ. ὅτ et ut corpora
lente auyeseuat, cr'to eatiapuuatur, sic inperia studiaque oppresseris
facilius, quem revocaveris, ibid. Agric. 3, where the first is sub·
junctive for indicative, the second perfect potentisl for present
potential.

§ea-The subjunctive is used, too, in relative clauses, where
the writer intends to convey the idea of an action frequently
repeated. This rule is, however, in all probability, identical with
one of the preceding, because the relative does not in these cases
refer definitely to any one case, but to all which might have taken
place, which not being always known, renders the relative clause
in a measure hypothetical. Thus, eo postquam Cesar pervenit,
obsides, arma, servos, qui ad eos persa pissea t, poposcit, Caes.
B. G. i. 27. It is bere implied that Caesar was aware that this
desertion had been going on, but he was probably not sware of
the extent of it, nor did he know definitely when it bad been

ractised.

p q 99.—-In the direct rhetorical question, which, from the nature
of the case, frequently occurs in the oratio alliquo, and where no
answcr is expected, the subjunctive is used3 as, quidnam id rei
esset, Liv. iv. 44.

cowobonnvo REMARKS·

j 100.—1 bave noticed elsewhere, that the relative with the sub·
junctive may be regarded as the type or pattern by which the use
of the subjunctive is rendered intelligible in other cases. A large
number of the conjunctions are of relative origin, or are mere relicts
of older forms of expression, in which ellipsis bas taken place, or
declinable forms have become fixed and adverbial. Hence depen-
dent sentences, with aa, ae, aum, ut, cur, quare, quamodo, ubi, uude,
lje. all take the subjunctive, while in direct sentences they take the
indicative. Among direct propositione, we must reckon ut when
