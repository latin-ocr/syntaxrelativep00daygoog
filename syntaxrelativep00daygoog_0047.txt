§23.-'l⁷here are many other of these uses of αὐτός, which,
although not exactly within the scope of this analysis, arc so far
connected with its illustration, that they may not be improperly
introduced here, that is, they illustrate a similar confusion os
clauses, analogous to what has just been pointed out with regard
to the relative clause, the province to which we have more ex-
pressly confined our attention in this treatise. The difference in
these cases is, that the demonstrative occurs twice, though we
cannot explain this by supposing that αὐτός is redundant, for the
construction often requires us to retain it. Neither is it necessary
to suppose that the αὐτός is emphatic in such instances. Where
the article and participle are used, we may regard them as equiva-
lent, of course, to a demonstrative pronoun and a relative. Thus,
aqi νικῶντι δώσω αὐτῷ, Rev. ii. 7.173 τῷ καθημίνῳ ἐδόθη
αὐτῷ, ibid. vi. 4. Here, τῷ νικῶντι, and τῷ καθημένῳ, contain both
the relative and demonstrative together, the participle implying

¹ the former, and the case indicating the latter3 but it is clear from

the practice of the writer, that τῷ νικῶντι was conceived of merely
as a relative clause, and accordingly it is so used in many other
passages, and takes the strictly relative syntax3 thaad νικῶν
καὶὸ τηρῶνδώσω cardinalia& ὁ νικῶυποιήσωαύτὸν,
ibid. iii. 12: ὁ νικῶν δώσω αὐτῷ, ibid. iii. 213 in all which,
and similar passages, ὁ νικῶν has merely the force and construc-
tion of the Latin qui uincit. This view of the case is also strongly
confirmed by the passage, καὶ isidam τὸ τρίτον τῶν κτισμά-
των τῶν ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ, τὰ ἔχοντα ψυχάς, Rev. viii. 9, and I
have no doubt this method of explanation which refers τὰ ἔχοντα
ἴοκτισμάτων as a relative clause, will do better than taking it as
put in apposition with τὸ τρίτον, which is the common view of the
case, if Ι rightly apprehend it. We have here only to assume
that τὰ ’ἔχοντα is solely arelative clause put in the same case as
the relative would be if it had been expressed. In asecond class
of examples the article is dispensed with, and αὐτός put in its
place, so that αὐτός is thus found expressed in both clauses, and
it is then customary for the first clause to assume anabsolute or
independent construction, while, in the second, the αὐτός indi-
cates the natural dependence. Sometimes this absolute construc-
tionis nominative, sometimes genitive, sometimes dative, and
sometimes accusative, though, as the case os the second αὐτός is
also one or other of these, it will osten huppen, that the first and
second αὐτός are in the same case with each other, and different
grammaticus, according to their several views, will treat such
cases as cases of attraction, govemment, or redundancy, at the
