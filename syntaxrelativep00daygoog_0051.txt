deoru ejecti reyes erant, ej uad em interfecti forent, Liv. ii. 20,
‘that oi what family the banishment of the kings was an honour,
of the same family should be the honour of their being slain.'
Not only the substantive, but the qualifying adjective is trans·
ferred into the relative clause3 as, Volsci perdideruat quam
urbem batumum optimam. But the qualifying adjective
sometimes undergoes this transition alone, without its substantive ;
as, hir munia quare ru apua pererrato statues que denique ponto,
Virg. AEn. ii. 2942 coluber tumidum quem bruma tepebat, ibid.
ii. 471. Again3 quero cur qui aditus ud caueam Hartcani
patuerit mitti interclusus erae detumit, Cio. pro Sull. 2, 4. In
the next example the substantive is transferred into the rela-
tive clause, and preserves its case, but we cannot separate the rela-
tive and substantive, and retain the construction, which must be
explained further by supposing an attraction3 imperat mititibua
Gerar ut naves faciant, cuj us penaria eum superioribus annia
uena Britannia docuerat, Caes· B. O. i. 54, for ejus pencris quod,
so also B. G. v. 2. This attraction, as it is called, is osten, as
here, only a substitution of the relative for the demonstrative
member, in which the relative undergoes the syntectical construc-
tion 0f the demonstrative, rather than that which its own verb
docuerat requires.

(b) Antecedent substantioe ira tte relative cluam ira a different case
from rotat it would be ira its own. 'l'he first example Ι shall quote
is the followingr er quina multisque aliis perspiciam ert, qui
¹fructur queque utilitates ec rebus iia, quie auntinuaimae,
percipiantur, eas aaa auito mado aine hominum manu atque opero
capere potuisse, Cic. Off. ii. 4, ‘it is evident that what advan-
tages acerne, th e se could not be available without the assist-
ance of man! I have generally observed, that most young stu-
dents in writing this as an exercise (vide Ellis), put the relative in
the accusative, and ear in the nominative. The reason is, that
firrrtua and utilitates are removed out of the demonstrativa clause,
and placed in that of the relative, whose case they take, and with
which it agrees as an adjective. Again, qui fit Macareus, ut remo,
quam sibi cortem seu ratio dedum reu sorr oh‘ecerit, itta
contentus vivat, Hor. Sat. i. 1, 1, for itta rorte qaam. Again3 necnon
et saci, qua cuique eet capia tati dorca ferunt, Virg. AEn. v.
100, where an ellipsis of eo in the ablativo, and a transference oi
eopia (ablat.) into the relative clause (nomin), has taken place3
