the fire, and burned. Our translatore should have supplied the
relative here, instead of copying a construction which is almost
unintelligible in English.

(c) Direct sar relative constitution. In addition to instances
given above, under the general rule, there are the following: tum
virqavu capit: hac animas itte evocat, itta fretus aqit ventos, δια,
Virg. AEn. iv. 242, where note that tric and itte are used os the
same subject. ln English, we have ‘a prinae called Hector,
Priam is his sether,' Shak. 'l'roilus and Cress. act i. sc. 3: ‘when
that this body did contain a spirit, a kingdom sor it was too small
a bound 3' I. Henry IV. act v. sc. 4. In a somewhat similar
manner the English translators of the N ew Testamcut use ‘him'
in place of the relative 3 as, ‘him would Paul have to go forth with
him,' and the same is true of the Greek original, where τοῦτον is
employed. Thus also ἔνθα, and corresponding words, have in
Greek osten a relative force; as, ἔνθα φόνιος ἦν δράκων, Eurip.
Phoeniss. 657. In instances of this sort, the editors almost in-
variably punctuate more fully, as if there was abreak in the cou-
nexion3 as, Virg. AEn. ix. 346, suadeteuim, ὅςας and again, 354,
sensit euim, aa: and thus their force, as relatives, is put out of
view, to which I object. Eodem modo primus eques hostium aqmi·
uis fiat, praerat Araus Tarquinius, fitius repis, reu ipse cam teqv'a-
uibur sequebatur, Liv. ii. 6: indutus at olim Demoleos aqebat, Virg.
AEn. v. 264. The repetition os the article in Greek with an
adverb, in appositiva with some preceding noun, is of the same
origin3 aa, ai γὰρ ἐντοῖς ξυμφοραῖς ταῖς νῦν, OEdip. Tyr. 496.
This, in other languages, is affected by means of an adjective ora
relative clause, ‘the calamities which at present affiict us.'

(d) Tlve relative pat a secaad time iu place os tu cuquuctiou.
Thus ὃς οὐκ ὄθετ’ αἴσυλα ῥέζων, ὃς τόξοισιν ’ἔκηδε θεοὺς, οἳὌλνμ-
που ἔχουσιν, Hom. ll. ε’. 404.

(e) The relative etlipticat iu oue part os a auteurs, but iufuved
from a precediuq relative. Many examples are met with, where
the relative only occurs once in a sentence, and must he supplied
again iu another case or form by inference. Thus, posteaquam ιἰι
vulqus militum etatum est, qua uvvoqautia iu colhquio Ariovistus
usca,- omui Gallia Romanis interdicisset, impetumque se·
visset, ἃμ. Caes. B. G. i. 46, where we must supply quomoda
inferred from qua in the former part of the sentence: ὃν ἡμεῖς
ἠθέλομεν βασιλέα καθιστάναι καὶ ἐδώκαμεν καὶ ἐλάβομεν πιστὰ,
Xenoph. Anab. iii. 2, ὅ : '‘ whom, and to whom, and from whom ε’
