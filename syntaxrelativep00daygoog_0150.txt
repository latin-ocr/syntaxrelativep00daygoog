where the interrogative arrangement takes the place of the negative.
Thus, theu, there is nothing more in these examplcs than the ordinary
Syntax, contained in the well-known expressions, nemo estqui, quir est
qui? The employment of talis, tantus, mm, merely as intensives, without
any qualis, quamue, or quem, occurring after thern has been sufficiently
exhibited in chap. vi. of this work. Thus has tam prosperas tamque in·
opinatae res consecuta est subita commutatio, Nep. in Dion. 6, where no
quam or adverbial relative clause is expected.

forms, atqui, atquin. The very common occurrence of que appended to
relative forms, aad the use of at in the ramesense as atqu, are further
corroboratione. As respecta inde, there is no more difficulty in supposing
thatin stood for eo, than that un stood for pao in ande. Hinc, too‚is
evidently closely connected from its use in dehinc (deinde), where it occu—
pies the place of an ablative‚ and from the fact that c was dropped in
words os this kind, and formed no part of the root3 as in illi for illic,
aud illim for illinc. The frequency with which the Greek o is changed
into a, in Latin derivativas, is familiar, and explains the connexion of
Greek and Latin relative forms ; and we can also trace a close relation-
ship between undique, and de quoque, uspiam aud quopiam, usquam, aa·
qaam and quoquam, usque and quoque. The numerous binary aad ternary
compoands, which words of the alias, qais, and a family form, are like·
wise well known, and a strong intimacy is thus marked. Itis common
to derive abi from the Greek 6που; but from its relationship to ibi, as ’
compared with that os unde to inde, one is strongly led to imagine that
the ἱ, in both words, is os the same origin, as well as the a. We cannot,
however, always lay much stress on the preservation of case in these
adverbs, nor is it necessary to show that hine was an ablative strictly in
form. In adeo, whose etymology is explained by the use of assuerit,
the ablative form is used aller od, which governs an accusative, there
bein little doubt that the meaning of adeo is that of aa id.

(ab page 68. § 36, Oba. 9. Quia is also used for ‘why not,’ where
its etymology is qao aaa, or cur non, and also followed by aa imperative,
where we can no longer substitute these interrogative adverbs, but where
it has clearly the same sense, though no longer suiting the construction.
Here is the first transition step to its thoroughly adverbial use, justas
below we see ne retained in passages where the interrogative sense is con·
tained, though the structure no longer properly admits it. In the meien-
ing of ‘ but‚' used at the commencement of a period and elsewhere, it has
deviated still more widely from its original signification, but the process
may be distinctly traced.

although the ne is in progress of extinction, its employment answers to
that of other interrogatives with the accusative and infinitive in the oblique
