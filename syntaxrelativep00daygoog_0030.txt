dedignata maritos, Virg. AEu. iv. 5353 but maritos does more than
occupy the place of Nomadum, and explains the point of view in which
, they had been disdaiued. It would therefore be better to translate, ‘whom
in the character of suitors for my hand Ι have so osten disdained.’

3. The passage quoted from Sallust above, tauta cara, pacato stadio,
is also analogous to au extensive class of examples which will come before
us presently. In the meantime it may serve to illustrate this paragraph.

b lta-Oui of the usage described in the last article, b 12, may
possibly have originated a class of examples in which the relative
pronoun refers to a different antecedent than the word with which
it is made to agree. In other phraseology it is objective to the
word with which it agrees as an adjective; as, per idem tempas
advorsum Gallos ab alambra austris, Q. Capiaae el M. Manlio, male
pugnatam. Quo metu Italia amab contremuerat, Sall. B. J . 114,
where it is customary to translate by ‘from the fear of which?
Of the same kind are aaa coaspectu, Eutrop. vi. 20: pao terrore,
Liv. i. 58: tumulas qao mmmo, Virg. AEn. iii. 22: qtaa tumultu,
Sall. Cat. 432 quo pauore, Liv. iv. 19.

Oba. Many, or most, of these examples are cases of the initial qai
aster a pause, and may be treated of under another head. See ξ 12. Ols. l.
This construction is not peculiar to the relative, but is a well-known
demonstrative usage3 as, atque hoo meta latius vayari prohibebat,
Caes. B. G. v. 19: hoo ira camaleria Volscam aprum legiones duxere,
Liv. ii. 22, ‘with anger on this account :’ hoc dolore, Caes. B. G. v. 4.

§la-When the antecedent refers to a class, rather than to
specified individuale, the relative pronoun olma takes the word
genas in its own clause3 as, additis perfiaais qood aeuus, Sall.
B.J.56: essedariis qao periere, Caes.B.G.iv.24: qtaod cap-
tioso aeaere interrogationis aleator, qaod aenas, &a (Incert.)

§la-When the verb sam appears by itself in the relative
clause, then this second antecedent appears as a predicate3 as
Garamam et Narbone, qua suat ciuitates Gallia praularia, Caes.
B. G. iii. 20: ea aaa secula esl hieme, aui fail araus Caelo Pom-
peio, Marco Crasso, Coss. ibid. iv. 1, ‘which was the year of the
consulate of Pompey and Crassus? The same observation may
be extended to passive verbs of calling or naming.

Ohs. This last instance is otherwise remarkable, from the substitution
of the ablative absolute, in apposition with araas in the nominative 3 but
is easily explained like other idioma, in which the mode of denoting a
thing is put for the thing itself‚ from the frequency of the expression. A
similar instance in Greek is the following ε-ἕν ἡμέρᾳ ἐπιλαβομένου
μου τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῶν, Heb. viii. 9. The names of the consuls are else-
where put for the year, usqae ad P. Sulpiciam et C. Aureliam consules,
Corn. Nep. Hannib. 7. See also Liv. iv. 30, oausam C. Seruiliam
Ahalam, L. P. Mugillanum causales.
