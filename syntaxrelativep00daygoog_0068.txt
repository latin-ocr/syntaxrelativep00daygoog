porting different degrm of indefiniteness, and it is not necessary
to be able to explain their etymology by a strict and regular deri-
vation. We have shown elsewhere that the douhling of the rela-
tive combination appears to be one recognized mode of marking
indefiniteness. 'Po exhibit the analogy of τις with one of its Latin
congeners, the following examples may be given: ὧδε δέ τις

εἴπεσκεν Ἀχαιῶν τε Τρώων rs, Hom. 11.y'.297. ὄφρα τις {daippus

καὶ ὀψιγόνων ἀνθρώπων, ibid. γ’. 353, in which τις answers exaotly
to quicqua· and, on the contrary, quisque, in the following Latin

passage, has a force scarcely different from the indefinite sense of ζ

τις, ‘ any ι’ ut quaque pare castrorum manto defemoribus presai
uidebatur, eo occurrere, et aueilium ferre, Caes. B. G. iii. 4. Quis,
in other circumstances, maintains its analogy, as in quisnam, a
compound made use of in direct and dependent questions, answer-
ing to τὶς γάρ in Greek, the Latin uam and γᾶρ corresponding in
signification. The adverbial compound quoniam is from quum
jam, or, as anciently written, quomjam.

Obs. l. Quisquis and quicunque, as Zumpt remarks, cannot alone form
the subject of a proposition, but must be united with a verb, in order to
become a part of some other proposition. See his Grammar‚ page 67.
Quisque is generally used as a substantive, and quidam isa kind of
adjective, implying that its subjectis definitely known, though indefinitely
described.

2. Quisque, like the Greek ἕκαστος, holten used in apposition, with a
plural subjeet3 as, illi exprobabant sua quisque belli merita cicatm·
aesque acceptas, Incert. In phrases like this, it follows the possessive
pronoun in position, though not agreeing with it, as it does the superlative
adjective when it does agree. Quisque is either used with a plural verb,
and has reference to a plural subject in the same ease with itself, or it is
used with a singular verb, in which ease it is used partitively with a
genitive plural; as, candidatorum conjecturam saciant quantum
quisque uuimi et facultatis babere vi d eatu r, cic. pro Muren. 21. 44.
In fact, quisque, in the nominative singular, may stand in apposition with
other cases than the nominative plural; as, multis sibi quisque
imperium petentibus, Sall. Jug. 183 and in those instances in which
quisque is used, as in the following, domum suam quemque iude alti·
turos, ueque maqis obseruaturos, Liv. i. 50, it has the meaning of
‘each and all.’ In Greek we have noticed several plural uses, where the
reference is toa singular antecedent. Thus, while quisque may signify
‘each and all,' so οὐδείς is equivalentto nutta- as, atde νὸς οὐδὲν
ζημιουμένου τῶν τὰς obuiae ἐχόντων, ἀλλὰ καὶ π ρ ο ah α μ β α ad ντ ω ν,
Dem. Philipp. Δ. ι’.

3. Quidquam is used with nihil in the same clause; as, comperiebam
uidit ad Pamphilum quidquam attinere, Ter. And. i. l, 64: and
thus we bave nemo witb uuus or quisquam ,· as, nemiuem uuum esse, Liv.
iii. la : uec quisquam uuus, Liv. ii. 9: memo quisquam, Ter. Hecyr. i. l, 10.
So nemo lroma⁴ Ter. Phorm. v. 3, 25. This ir done in Greek3 as, ἀλλ’
