to an implied subject3 aa, μὴ γὰρ uide δαίμονες θεῖίν μ’ ἄφωνον
τῆσδε τῆς ἆρῖις ἔτι, tc με, κ. τ. λ. OEdip. Col. 862. See also the
examples under the head of Ellipsis. This construction, κατὰ
σύνεσιν, is not uncommon iu Thucydides3 as, εἴ τι χρὴ κάνταῦθα
πιστεύειν, ἢ ν εἰκὸς, ιι. τ. λ. Thucyd.i.10, for καὶπερὶ ταύτης τῆς
στρατείας λέγοντι. So μέλλοντας below for the genitive. See
Arnold.

§6L—Several cases occur in which the relative is found acci- .
dentally, which do not particularly belong to the relative syntax, or
present any peculiarity merely characteristic of it Thus the subject
is sometimes expressed only in the subordinate member in com-
parisons3 as, Caute suburbano qui εἰααια crevit ia cyris θαὶαἰοτ,
Ηοτ. Sat. ii. 4, 15, but this is often the case with adjectives3 as,
ec uois penninas milri conficies nuptias, Ter. And. iv. 1, 51 ι Calabris
Lucana mutet pascuis, Hor. Epcd. i. 27: Picenis cedunt
pomis Tiburtia succo, ibid. Sat. ii. 4, 70: quippe duos pro
uao domino acceptos, Liv. iii. 9. ln the annexed example, the
causal relative is put after another relative pronoun as the antece-
dent: ὡς οὔτ’ ἂν ὃς νῦν σκῆπτρα καὶ θρόνους ἔχει μείνειεν, οὔτ’ ἂν
οὖὲεληλνθώς πάλιν ἔλθοι ποτ’ αὖθις· oi γε, κ.τ.λ. Soph.
OEdip. Col. 421. Occasionally, a verb which takes ordinarily one
of two constructions, takes both together, and the relative may
happen to be found in such an arrangement3 as, οὓς οὺ μή τοτε
χώρας φυγόντες τῆσδ’ ἐπεθξωνται θεοῖς, ibid. 1021. Here
the only peculiarity is, that φεύγω takes either an accusative of the
person, or a genitive of place, but both constructions are found in
this place, and the relative is the accusative of person.

§bk-verbs of asking, in Greek and Latin, take two accusa-
tives, one of the person from whom any thing is asked, and the
other of the thing sought. This is also in Greek extended to the
person or thing respecting whom a question is asked3 as, ὁπότερον
καὶ ἐρωτᾷς ; Plat. Euthyd. 271, A, ‘respecting which do you
inquire ?' ὃν ἐρωτᾷς, ibid. B, ‘respecting whom you ask? This
is not peculiar to the relative, as another substantive is sometimes
put in apposition3 aad δὲ σὺ ἐρωτᾷς τὴν σοφίαν αιἰτοῖν, θαν-
μασία, ibid. C, ‘concerning what you ask, viz. their wkdom, it is
wonderful? But still this construction does not appear to have
always satisfied the writer, as περὶ αὐτῶν is subjoined. Thus, a
νῦν δὴ ἠρωτῶμεν περὶ αθτὼν; Plat. Theaet. 185, C, which in this
form strongly reminds us of the construction πᾶν ῥῆμα ιἰργὸν . . . .
περὶ αὐτοῦ, Matt. xii. 36, though different. The last passage from
Plato, in lact, contains two constructions. The one περὶ αὐτῶν in
place of an accusative aster ἠρωτῶμεν, in the sense of ‘whom do you
