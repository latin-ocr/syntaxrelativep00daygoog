quis emicas, Ter. Heaut. ii. 2, 6: ne se qaoque ut patrem Hemit-
earem casus aliquis opprimeret, Liv. xxi. 41 cdi moa dedit at 1-
quid? Ter. Adelph. i. 2, 703 but eui is here interrogative, when
the rule does not hold, Ι believe. In the following passage we
have both together: si que forte et iqmand ο fimnat, Liv. v.
35 si quid hujus simile forte aliquando everterit, Ter. Heaut.
iii. 2, 40.

Obs. Where the si, or conditional particle, belongs particularly to the
verb, and rendere the whole clause strictly hypothetical‚ it is freely fol·
lowed by aliquis, which pretty clearly shows that neither issi redundant,
as it is commonly said to be, nor does the qui or qais, in the cases where
it is ¹used, stand for aliquis. Quis sometimes stands by itself, however,
where aliquis is more usual; and, on the other hand, quis is used where
the si has reference more properly to the verb, as in Virgil, AEn. iii. 433,
where the writer of the Interpretotio supplies qais by aliquis ; and again,
si quem similem ejas irati Dii tribunum dedissent, Liv. iii. 9.

ᾧ ata-»In the majority of instances it will be seen, that si quior
si qais is really an equivalent word to quietemque, and that it might,
with propriety, be printed as one word, siquis, as it enjoys all the
properties of the simple relative. Zumpt has not here clearly
noticed the difference of siquis, regarded as one word, and si fol-
lowed by aliquis, where the si rather belongs to the verb, and
makes the sentence quite hypothetical. In the use of si quis, on
the contrary, it is often not meant to be implied, that there is any
doubt of the existence ,of the action or state implied by the verb,
but that all, whatever may be so affected or circumstanced, under·
goes some other relation. Thus, erempere si quid inesset boni,
Cic. Off. iii. 1: meque eye unquam torta perdidisse dicam si qui
peotes out supellectitem amiserit, Cic. Paradox. i. 1: 1111 etiamsi
qm os obscura nocte per umbram fudimus insidiis totaque agitavimus
arde, appareat, Virg. AEn. ii. 420: atque ommia ferre sub ouras si
qua tegant, ibid. ii. 159: Di tibi, si qma pios respectant numina,
‘si qu id usquamjmstitiae est et mens sibi cereseio recti premia digno
ferant, ibid. i. 6073 ‘may the gods, may whatever deities there
are, who respect the pious, may justice wherever it is to be found,
and conscious rectitude of mind, confer an adequate reward 3'
where the two si quis clauses are only exegetical of Di. So in
Greek, medior ἅπαν ὁμαλὸν ὥσπερ θάλαττα, ἀψινθίου δὲ πλῆρες
si df τι καὶ ἄλλο ἐνῆν ὕλης, κ.τ.λ. Xen. Anah. i. 5, l: ikl’t
’πὶ φορβῆς νόστον ἐξελήλυθεν, ἢ φύλλον t't' τι νώδυνον κᾶτοιδὲ
που, Soph. Philoc. 43, where the construction is, ἐπὶ νόστον φύλ-
λου νωδῦνον ὅ τι κάτοιδέ που, and an attraction has taken place.
The Greeks even carry this further than the Latina, for they use
ε1 τις as a definite partitive, where the Latius would require atiqdis
