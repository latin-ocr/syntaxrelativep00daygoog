obs. 1. Many of the examples that might be quoted under this head,
however, require to be distinguished. Take, for instance, the following:
τὴν δύναμιν ἐφ’ οὓς, Xenoph. Anab. v. 1, 83 and ούδὲν ἂν ἔδει dv
μέλλω λέγειν, ibid. v, l, 10: σύ νυν ἀφεὶς σεαυτὸν, ὦν λέγεις πέρι,
Soph. OEdip. Tyr. 680. Iu the first case there is actually an ellipsis of
τούτων, dependent upon δύναμιν; in the two which follow, the relative
clauses are more strictly objectiva, and supply the place of the aute-
cedent or demonstrative. The first is the most rare. ln Greek, from the
tendency which the relative has to conform itself to the structure of the
antecedent, it appears osten as though it really filled its place3 aud we
cannot resort to the supposition of ellipsis, without, in many cases, further
supposing an attraction to have taken place. ln other examples itis
- difficult tondetermine whether the relative is under the influence 01 the
verb in its own or in the antecedent clause.

2. ln other passages we may explain the construction in several ways;
i. e. the explanation may be sought under this or some other rule. Thus,
si ehartce sileam qu od benefeceris mercedem tuleris, Hor. Od. iv. 8, 21. ,
11 is here difficult to say whether we are 1ο understand de eo after sileant,
or ejus aster mercedem ; and perhaps it is sufficient to suppose that the
