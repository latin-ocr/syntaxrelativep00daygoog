this sort, may we not explain at once why quod 18 used adjectively,
and prid substantively, followed by a genitive which is common
after id ⁸? as, quid 8811818 est? Ter. And. 111.88.4,21. Such a
supposition 88 this will not interfere at all with the cases where
quid is used not interrogatively, because qui, in like manner, is
often coupled with a substantive in its own clause, where no
interrogation is eonveyed, and the use of quid is thus strictly ana-
logous. Thus for example in the following: quo prelio 81111811
Helvetii, Caes. B. G. i. 45, ‘by which battle being listed up,’ where
we may either say that pato is a mere demonstrative pronoun with
copula, or that the real primitive construction is eo pre lio quod
nominaui, the relative being here, on the contrary, transferred into
the case and clause of the demonstrative ⁸. But, aster all, these
remarks 011 the composition of puis may be of no value, especially
if its etymology is drawn from the Greek τίς, 01 11, as 8 writer in
the first number of the Journal of Education supposes, put is a
soltened and shortcned form of puis. At all events, qui aud puis
arc not used indifferently for one another, which the last-named
writer should have proved, in order to establish the parallelism of
this change, with that of the second person passive of verbs, and
third perfect active plural, into re. Ihave elsewhere hinted, that
these forms are probably analogous to that of the historic intini-
tive, for the indicative form. It appears to me, that the writer, in

question, 18 bound to show, that qui, sisere, mirare, the sostened
forms effected by time, gained ground among later writers, in

⁸ Though, as a general rule, qaid 18 used substantively, aud quod adjec-
tively, yet quod osten occurs followed by a genitive3 88, quod frumenti,
Caes. B. C. i. 34: qaod superest fol l oei ae, Ter. Heaut iv. 5, 28:
quod impensae sactum in bellum erat, Liv. ii. 18. Quia and qui are
both used partitively‚ and therefore as substantives3 and aliquia 18 011811
used 88 an ad'ective in the singular, ubi eut mitia for alicui, andpartitively
in the plural; as, ne quirinillus, Liv.ii.24, where militis stands for
militum, as a noun of multitude. In interrogative sentences, likewise,
pratis 18 used as an adjective; as, quia enim dies fuit quem? Cic. pro

uren. 22. 46.

⁶ In Greek, as we have already seen, the construction of the interro-
gative with the antecedent in its clause, is varied by the addition of the
demonstrative pronoun3 as, τίνα τόνδ’ ἐπηράσω λόγον, Soph. Elect.
381. still more curicus is the use 01 τίνος in the genitive absolute, with
a participle as a kind of conjunction. Τ1ιιι8, rol ὁ Ἀστυάγης ἰδὼν, teat-
1811 1111111.1111111811· 11· 811181
particlesy and conjunctione, but a greater freedom of cobstruction for
connecting their dependent clauses, and, among others, this by the genitive
absolute is not uncommon.
