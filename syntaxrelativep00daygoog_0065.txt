presence must be explained in a similar way to that adopted in the
last chapter. The following examples illustrate the use of qai
interrogative; as, qui denique ec bestiis fructus, aot quc
commoditas obi homines adorarent percipi posset? Cic. de
off. itt: quibus tandem gradibus Romulia escerrdit ia οω-
lom? ro res adseram Porsenae &Muciumimpotiw Quc iis
Coclitem contra omues bostium copias torsit ia ponte solum? cic,
Paradox. i. 2. An examination of either of these examples will teach
us, that here the antecedent is transferred into the relative clause,
an ellipsis takes place, and yet the same force is conveyed as
though the sentence was strictly expressed. The full enunciation
would be, rogo ut dicos modos, quitata Romaim aa Dio milti
causam or rem quo impulit. Now, grammarians distinguish be-
tween quis interrogative, and qui, and it hardly appears that they
do so with sufficient reason, aster we have excepted the mere
forms qais and qaid themselves. With these two exceptione, all
the other cases of the one are the same as those of the other, and ·
a reason may easily be found for these exceptione. Observa then,
that the relative qui, when used interrogatively, has usually a sub·
stantive in the same case and clause with itself3 while in the
general use of qnia quid, no such arrangement obtains, at least not

primarily, though one was admitted3 as, quis miles? Where the
nominative masculine and neuter singular quia quid, occur in

interrogatione, a substantive is very generally absent from the
clauses in which they are found, while in the oblique cases, or
with qui, qaod, under similar circumstances, it is usually present
As the oblique casas of quis do not differ from those of qui, there
is no means of, and no reason for distinguishing them. We are
led rather to suppose that quis, qnid, are two forms that are equi-
valent to some other combination‚ and are used for a particular
purpose. Without laying any stress on the matter, may we not
suppose that quis stands for qni is, and that quid contains also the
element id, transferred into the relative member, in the way we
have already pointed out ¹? And thus by a simple arrangement of

⁴ I have elsewhere noticed that quoad may be a kind of ecthlipsis for
qood ad, and qvid may be for qood id, in the sarna way as the comic poeta
pronounce aed before a vowel, or quid under like circumstances; as in the

following: iteam} ddtdltis sdlild unlud nosltrci affl, Ter. Phorm. v.

7, 47, scanned as an lambio Trimeter Acatalectic, which I prefer to the

reading totam Ι dotdltis adlild quw Ι nostrii attat, in which nibil is made

adissyllable, and nostro is made ablativa feminine singulm, according to
the common, though improperly, received view, instead of neuter accu-
sative plural, as it may be satisfactorily shown to be.
