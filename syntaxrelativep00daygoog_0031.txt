CHAPTER III.

THE RELATIVE 11¹8qu ELLIPTICAL, AND ‘THE USE OF THE
Drauci* uolt THE RELATIVE STRUG'I'URE.

Elliplical Relalive.

ξ 16.—Cases of this sort are uot very frequent, aud occur mostly
in familiar idioms3 as, velat ora aenaeam, αἱμοῤῥοΐδας Greci appel-
lant, Celsus ii.: carucarum quadam penora dolentia ἅκροχορδόνας
Greci appellant, ibid: tres Notas abreptas in :aaa latentia torquet.
Sana vocant Itali, mediisque in fluctibns Aras, Virg. AEn. i. 109:
in Lernelios Liparia para est, Tac. agric. 7 : qni mercatorias aaran:
illam ipsam mercatus aravit, Hor. Sat. ii. 6, 12, ‘who purchased
the very land which as a mercenary he ploughed :' arba antiqua
fait, Tyrii tenuere coloni, Virg. AEn. i. 12: est laena Hesperiam Graii
coynomiae dicant, ibid. i. 530: terra procul lhraces arant, Virg.
AEn. iii. 13.

Direct sor Relative Stractnre.

This is seen in the following 2-Maltarbale Himilconis filio, eam
prefecerat Hannibal, ita impiyre rem aperite, Liv. xxi. 12: is eo
mvn coercita, ibid. iii. 1: is enirn carn Sp. Postumio consalsait, ibid.
iii. 2: id remedium timori fnit, ibid. iii. 3: ad eo ciuitates, &c ibid.
iii. 4: ita tarn, &c ibid. : frater id ent, ibid. iii. 5.

otu. 1. ln the last examples the demonstrative prououn or adverb is
introduced, which proves that the structure was not intended to be relative.
The editors often include sentences of this sort within brackets: but this
appears to me unnecessary‚ and even tabe productive of an erroneous
view of the case. Itis certainly better to regard this usage as a particular
construction or peculiarity of style, than to resort to the mechanica}
process of walling up a whole proposition between barriers, as if it were
prohibited. The writers who employ it evidently do so for the sake of
an agreeable diversification, and to avoid the monotouy of the relative
construction.

2. In other cases the ellipsis is more than one of the relative. In the
following we must understand eo qaod, aud the abrupt omission is very

’ marked3 an baccis opulentet oliooe, pomisne, an pratis, an amicta

vitibus almo, Hor. Epist. i. 16, 2.

3. Sometimes, in Latin, asin Greek, the participle stands in lieu of
the relative construction, and expresses the cause of a particular condition3
as, O feliciana antealias jassa mori, Virg. AEn. iii. 321, ‘happy in
being required to die.'
