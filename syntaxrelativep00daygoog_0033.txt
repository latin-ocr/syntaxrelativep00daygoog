river, rei οὐκ εἶσί, Rev. ii. 2. 9. iii. 7. 9, and elsewhere. This
Δ practice seems to be very characteristic of st. John's writings, or
rather he indulges it freely. Itis also met with in st. Paul, where
it is probable, from the punctuation, that the editors do not under-
stand the construction ε ἐγ ε l ρ α ς αὐτὸν ἔκ νεκρῶν, καὶ ’κ d θι σε ν,
Eph. i. 20, where they put the colon aiter νεκρῶν.

(b) fremitleo from tlte relative to tlte direct coaetmctioa. The
first I may quote is, τὸ μὲν ού δύνατ’ ἄλλος Ἀχαιῶν πάλλειν, ἀλλά
μιν οἶος ἐπίστατο πῆλαι Ἀχιλλεύς, Hom. Il. π’. 142, and again,¹
Il. τ’. 389, ‘which no other of the Greeks was able to wield, but
Achilles alone knew how to wield it? I of course choose to
regarded as the relative, and remark, in passing, that this example
is of a different kind from some I shall have to quote presently,
the relative and demonstrative being here each in a distinct mem*
ber of the whole period, which sometimes are found in one and the
same member. Again, ὅστις ἔτ’ ἄβλητος καὶ ἀνούτατος tta·
χαλκῷ δινεύοι κατὰ μέσσον, ύγοι df ἑ Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη χειρὸς iloto,
αὐτὰρ βελέων ἀπερύκοι ἐρωήν, Hom. Il. δ’. 540, where we have ἑ
instead of δν. Το this head belong examples in which the struc-
ture commenced is not persevered in„but a fresh one is begun
where no relative is met with. Thus, ol γε τὸν φύσαντ’ ἐμὲ
οὕτως ἀτίμως ..... ἤμυναν, ἀλλ’ ἀνάστατος αύτοῖν ἐπέμφθην,
OEdip. Col. 423, where I would put a comma only at ἤμυνανι
πεύσεται γὰρ ἄλλο μὲν ἆστερηὲς οὐδέν, γῆς δ’ ἄπεισιν ἆβλαβὴς,
OEdip. Tyr. 223: βᾶθι βᾶθι τάνδε γᾶν σού νιν ’ἔκγονοι κτίσαν,
Eurip. Phoen. 681: Ἕκτορ, τίπτε μάχης ἇποπαύεαι, ovidi τί σε
χρή, Hom. Il. π’. 721. These last four cases might be consi-
dered as containing nothing more than the direct, in lieu of the
relative construction, and so far belong to §163 but it will be
seen on examination, that they are essentially different3 the first
member of the sentence implying a construction which is sud-
denly departed from in the second, and which differs from amere
parenthesis. A curicus instance is the following, ού καθὼς Κάῖν
ἐκ τού πονηροῦ ἦν καὶ lopo Εε τὸν ἆδελφὸν αὑτοῦ, 1 John iii. 12.
This may be regarded as a mere case of the ellipsis of the relative
prououn ὅς atter Κύϊν, or we may adopt an arrangement, of which
cases are not wanting in English, ‘not of the evil one as Cain was,
and killed his brother? Itis absurd to say, that καί has here the
force of qai, though this substitution might make out a construc-
tion. In such phrases as the following, Stallbaum has noted, that
the relative is usually wanting, or, what is perhaps still more
correct, that a direct construction takes its placer λέγω γὰρ δὴ τὸ
