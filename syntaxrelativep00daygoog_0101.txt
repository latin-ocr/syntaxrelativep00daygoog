§tta-The following passage exhibita this displaeement of the
natural order, and some other peculiarities: quanto per Idmon,
seomeffasaMyeenis, tempestas ierit onmem,- quibas octus
uterque,Emopceatqaeriae,fotie concurreritorbis; audiit,
et si qoem tettae antremo resino submovet oceano, et si qnam
ententn plagarum quotuor in medio dffimit' playa sotis iniqui, Virg.
AEn. vii. 222. Here audiit is placed aster the clauses quanta tem-
pestas, tyn, quibas fotis, tyn, the subject nominative is is wanting,
and the si poem clauses, which supply its place, follow the verb of
which they constitute the subject, or of which they at least forma
part or qualification.

§sn-This postponement of the antecedent member is some·
times productiva of a little difficulty, because the real dependence
is not at once perceived. Thus, qnod animadverti te ferre moderate,
qa od autem aa nonis in nostro collegio non afflicter invalitudinem
consa non mestitiam fnisse, Cic. de Am. 2. 8, where the second
qttod depende on causa. This difficulty is sometimes further aug-
mented, when the antecedent so postponed is likewise elliptical3
as, itaque snos cohortatus qn oa integros superavissent nt victos con·
temnerent, Caes. B. C. ii. 5, where victos is postponed to qnos, and
eoois wanting, the sense being, ‘accordingly having encouraged
his soldiers to despise those enemies now conquered, whom they
had overcome when in the full and unimpaired possession of their
strength ⁴.'

§tn-In passages of oratorical force or emphasis, the relative
commonly precedes, and hence the very usual occurrence of patente,
qno, followedby tanto and eo.

sse.-At other times, the demonstrative and antecedent sub-
stantive are separated, and the relative clause placed between them.
In this case the demonstrative pronoun precedes; as, eu que
secuto est nieme, Caes. B. G. iv. 1: celeriter ad eae qnos dicimus
munitiones, ibid. iii. 3, 263 and indeed some cases of what has
·been termed the transposition of the demonstrative, where the
demonstrative pronoun is not inserted, might be explained on this

principle; as, restitue qoem n me occepisti locam, Ter. And. iv.
1, 57, where, by interposing enm aiter restitue, we should conform
the structure to the examples above3 so that the passage would
read, restitue enm, onem n me accepisti, locam. So in the fol-

⁴In comparative sentences, the facts or sentimenta that are eom-

pared sometimes precede the comparative adjective, and thus qnam will
occur before the latter, on which it is dependent3 as, se in tempore et sine
ignominia seruasse exercitam, qnam malta millia hostium occidisse, mo-

jorem gloriam esse, Liv. xxii. 25.
