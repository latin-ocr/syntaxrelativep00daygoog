neensmx. 135

Bacchidi dono sciens? Ter. Heaut. v. 5, 6, the ae clearly imports the
interrogative character of the sentence, while theat dem depends on some-
thing implied 3 as, ‘I be such a fool as to give‚’ the construction partaking
of the interrogative and interjectional. Two passages have been quoted
in note 8 to this reference, containing atae, as supposed to be used for
chamna. These admit, however, of being classed with those immediately
preceding, partaking of the interrogative and interjectional character as
they do. The nc may here indicate the interrogative manner of the
speaker; the ct, the actual construction.

(a) page 73. 5 37, (e). 1 have neglected to notice some examples of
double interrogatives in Latin of a different kind from any mentioned in
the place here referred to. Quid, interrogative, is not unfreque'ntly found

⁴ preceding another interrogative sentence, as in the following3 qaid enim
lttttttttttttlt.¹3²llt²t⁷22.t.t⁰.tttttttt,ttlrttll
dones conoe Demetrium reliquerant? qaid? Lacedaemonios nonae,
dc? Cic. Off. ii. 7, where notice also that Dionysium, Alexandrum,
Macedones, and Lacedaemonios, are each taken out of their clause, and
made to precede it. Similarly, quid? qum imbelles dant proelic
cerri? Virg. Georg. iii. 265. ·

(τ) page 80. 5 39, (b). The clause to which the relative, as demon·
strative and conjunctim, belongs, may be a part of another relative clause,
'belonging to the subject of another objective relative clause, as in the fol-
lowing: carim stodiam qai vituperat, hond sane intelligo, quidnam sit, qaod
laudandam patet, Cic. de Off. ii. 2, where the real construction is, et hand
intelligo qnid id ait qaod is, qai vituperet ej as (or id) stadium, patet lca·
dandam. This rendere the construction more complicated, and causes it

¹ ¹ toasume the appearance of anacoluthon, though it maybe easily analysed

and found not to be so.

lhave, perhaps incautiously, put the rule as to the initial qni, some·
what too generally. lt often happens that the ordinary and strictly rela-
tive clause is taken out of its natural position and put before that to which
it belongs, either as an explanatory or objective clause, and thus qai will
stand at the beginning of a period, where it is not referred to any subject
immediately preceding it in the former period. Thus, qai recte vivendi
,prorogat horam rusticus expectat, Hor. Ep. i. 2, 41: qni capit oct metuit
jurat illum, ibid. 51: qni nort moderabitur irre, infectum nolet esse, ibid.
59, where the qni in each case occurs after a full point.

(υ) page 90. 549, Ohs. Si is used in other cases, where it is no
mark of the hypothetical sentence, but has something of its primitive
force, sine or sit, ‘granted that,’ whichever explanation is preferred; as,
da quibas dicere aggredienti panca primda imtitoto cc dejudicio meo
dinero, Cic. off. ii. 1, where Valpy quotes Virg. AEn. v. 64, 65. See
also Cic. off. ii. 6, si prins dixerimus, near the end.

(φ) page 92. § 52, Obs. 3. In the annexed we have si qni with the
subjunctive, and si qais with the indicative, but in neither case is the
clause an objective one, the first verb being in the potential, more pro-
perly speaking3 ct si qui insero cantet, att si qua est alic
magra perversitas, Cic. Off. i. 40.
