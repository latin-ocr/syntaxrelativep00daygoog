instance of the interrogation not used for an assertion, but a
strong negation 3 Zdo' ἐς θανόντων ἔρχομαι κατασκαφάς· ποίαν

THE RELA'PIVE PRONOUN IN THE CONSTRUG'I'ION ΟΡ 'rna

ἦ 38. ln a former edition of this work, Ι treated of these oon-
structions under two distinct heads3 viz, ‘Anacoluthon ot' the
Relative ζ’ and ‘The Relative in the construction of the Accusative
and InfinitiVe,' though not without some doubt as to the pro-
priety of such a division, as will appear immediately. Alter
quoting some examples of inconclusive structure, where the real
subject of the verb seems to be forgotten, and a different arrange-
ment from the expected one takes place, I proceeded to observe,
‘ Perhaps, too, it may be objected, that this species of annotare is
not properly to be regarded as incomplete or inconclusire3 but
that qui is, in all these cases, put for the pronoun ia and the copu-
lative conjunction, and is, in reolity, the nominative to the verb in
the conditional clause which accompanies it. I care not which
view of the matter is taken, since the peculiarity is equally well
illustrated by whatever name we designate it. The mode of view-

ing it, however, here proposed, enables us to extend our principle
to such cases as the following3 attat eat araim matuta amabilior,

⁹ Many cases of apparent anacoluthon are explained by ellipsis3 as, d
biii ttlattlt thttttttttattttttttttptttttttt‘
is, thail the relative begins the sentence, leading you to expect another
construction. The occasional introduction of the demonstrative in the
subsequent part of the sentence proves, however, that this is only a case
of transposition, and that the idea of ellipsis is applicable. Ihave already,
under the head of ‘ Attraction,' treated of some other cases of ‘anaco-
luthon' which may be referred to §25, (d) Oba. lt is not always easy
to determine the case of tha attracted words, and it is even very question·
able, whether we are doing right, in classing examples of this sort under
this head. The very common introductiones αὐτός with a proposition,
exhibiting the natural syntax, is in favour of the supposition, thatthe real

yubjlect was thus freed from ita usual construction, aud praeposed abso·
