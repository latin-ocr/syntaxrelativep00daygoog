P (ι) page 25. 0 19, Oba. at the top. Homer uses the relative form at
the beginning of a period, where the demonstrative which should precede
it is postponed, as in the following passage, though the use of γάρ shows
that it should he regarded as continuous with what goes before, αἳ γὰρ ὑπ’
ἡελίρ τε καὶ οὐρανῷ ἀστερόεντι ναιετάουσι πόληες ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων,

τ’. 429, exhibiting transposition from'the cdse of the partitive genitive τάων,
to that of the relative, with which the noun so transferred is made to agree.
A curiously abrupt case with ὅστις inceptive occurs, Il. δ’. 240. Homer
also uses rol, ταί for the plural of the prououn‚ ἀλλ’ ἦτοι ταὶ, νόσφι
καθήμεναι, ll. δ’. 9. lu a great many instantes, rol, roi plurals nominative
are followed by δέ, γάρ, γε, showing that the structure is demonstrative or
direct, ‘they,' ‘these,’ but in others again they appear to be used exactly
as relatives. Thus τοί is followed by δέ, Il. α’. 447. β’.52.149. 151.
ν’ 883. d. 361. 375. τ’. 546. 571. ψ’. 202. 212. 369. 449. 847. ln χ’. 254,
it is followed by γάρ. lu φ’. 608. ψ’. 217, it is followed by ys: and in
β. 52 it is preceded hy ol μέν, in a partitive sense, similarly to the example
noted Pind. Olymp. xiii. 58, only the order is reversed. Iu ν’. 87. ρ’. 145.
υ’. 299. φ’. 267. χ’, 53, it is used for the simple relative, and in β’. 846.
u‘. 308, it is followed, like the relative prououn‚ by κέν, and iu 0. 225 by
ῥά. In these cases it will be seen on examinatiou, that τοὶ δέ usually
occurs in the initial position, and may be regarded as a demonstrative
prououn. The two examples of τοι’ γε occur where otherwise hiatus
would take place before the τ. The employment of rol by itself for the
relative pronoun occurs in every instance where hiatus would otherwise
take place, or ashort syllable requires to be lengthened by position, which
is also discsse with rol κέν, ll. β’. 846. In the remaining instances,
υ’. 808 with κέν, d. 225 with ῥά, it occurs siber a short caesural syllable.
These facts seem to indicate clearly, that the rol form was not unfrequeutly
preferred for the, sake of the metre. Another circumstance deserving of
notice is, that uot only is the τός form used where we translate hythe
relative, but there is reason to believe that the so-called relative was itself
ademonstrative prououn. Hence we occasionally meet with it in what
may be termed its transition state : Ζεὺς, ὄσ τ’ ἀνθρὼπων ταμίης πολέμοιο
τέτυκται, Hom. Il. δ’. 84, and again η’. 208. This ὅστε is of kindred
nature with ὁ δέ, which is often found where the relative might be put,
arrd which l have elsewhere spoken of, page 25. 819, Oba. This use of
ὁ δέ also might be given as exemplifying transition from the relative to the
direct or demonstrative construction, which is well seen iu the following:
ὅν ῥά ποτ’ αὐτὸς, ὑπὸ στέρνοιο τυχήσας ....... βεβλήκει πρὸς στῆθος,
ὃ δ’ ὕπτιος ’ἔμπεσε πέτρῃ, Il. δ’. 106, where, 100, notice the repetition
aster parenthesis, not uncommon in Homer. As it will be more satis-
factory to present at one view the way in which these fonus of article,
demonstrative, relative, and partitive are used, Ihave supplied the fol-
lowing table, which contains the sum of what has been embraced in the
