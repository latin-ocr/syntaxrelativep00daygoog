the very common one, in which the relative is used interrogatively,
with a substantive in agreement with it in its own clause, of ‘which
Ineed not stop to furnish examples. The second, where a verb
requiring a sentence, and nota mere word, for its object, which
sentence is either in the construction of the Accusative and
Infinitive, or at and the subjunctive, or some other relative clause,
requires the subject of the relative sentence, or the said subject of
the infinitiva, to be expressed in it. Thus we more commonly
say aptarat atille νιναι, than illam, ιιι aaut, optant, though the
last occurs3 and it is in this construction that the Greeks and
Latins so much differ, the latter¹ method being much more common
with the former, and the former method with the latter. The
substantive that goes with the relative may, however, be either the
object or subject of the relative sentence3 but, in either case, the
Greeks are fond of placing it as the object of the preceding verb,

or in its place a neuter pronoun. Thus, ὅσων δὲ δὴ καὶ οἵων ἂν
ἐλπίδων ἐμαυτὸν στερήσαιμι, εἴ σέ τι κακὸν ἐπιχειρήσαιμι ποιεῖν,
τ adra λέξω, Xen. Anab. ii. 5, 10, ‘but of how many and of what
' kind of hopes I should deprive myself, these I will tell? In

Latin, however, we should say, olim aava quarere amabam qao
auser ille pedes lavisset Sisyphus σι r e, Hor. Sat. ii. 3, 21, not ama·
bam quaerere aes qao. In these examples, the proper objects to
quarere and λέξω are not aes and ἐλπίδας, but the respective clauses
in which they are found. This construction is more harsh and
unusual, however, and seems to come under the head of the mixed
relative and demonstrative construction spoken of before, when
this substantive so coupled with the relative, citharas subject or
object, has another word depending on it, as in the following, acea
Pdrppa’a audisti, moda iste bomo qaam villam demonstravit
Charini? Ter. Heaut. iv. 4, 9, where we have vil lam Charini
in the relative clause. The third class of examples to which
I have referred is, that in which the relative is put merely for the
conjunction and demonstrative pronoun, and cannot be distin-
guished from the latter in construction. Thus, aaa l ibertas
ιιι latior esset prosim repis superbia fecerit, Liv. i. 2, ‘which liberty
the pride of the last king had rendered more grateful? In conse-
quence of the qua libertas having been taken out of the at clause,
there is an apparent awkwardness about this passage. It stands,
however, merely for et superbia rapis fecerit at ea libertas, ᾳιιιιιιι
aaa, letior esset. Again, qaae si causa uocasset tamen, &a
quoted above, foret si ea caasa aaa esset. In such like passages,
the whole is rendered clear by substituting for the relative pro·
